[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Joyent is embracing of Go's contribution to distributed, enterprise,
production-grade computing and celebrates the software engineering ethos held by
many in the Go community because their beliefs are aligned with our
https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0104[General Principles].

In this document we will define and articulate Joyent's evolving set of
best-practices with regards to how to Go.

Each item has a recommendation and a rationale.  Over time these recommendations
and rationale are apt to evolve and be refined to further reflect our
experiences.  Omissions or gaps in the list of items, the recommendations, or
their rationale is almost certainly unintentional.  At times several of the
recommendations or rationale become pithy due to time constraints or the
perceived lack of a need to provide a more robust explanation, and similarly,
this is unintentional.  If an issue warrants additional discussion, please
<<contributing,open an issue>>.

[[contributing]]To provide feedback, bug fixes, request clarification, or
initiate a discussion, please open an
https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/rfd/issues/new[RFD issue] and reference
https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0106[`RFD 106`] along with the
necessary specifics.  For issues where there is a debate or discussion, this
document will include a link back to the individual issues where a particular
item was addressed or debated.

This RFD makes use of terminology defined in
https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14[BCP 14]
(https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC 2119] and
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174.txt[RFC 8174],
i.e.  "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL").

[[version-of-go,reftext=go-version]]
== Version of Go

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. The latest released version _or_ a current
   https://twitter.com/bradfitz/status/889898218573766656[release candidate] of
   Go SHOULD be used for day-to-day development.
2. A released version of Go or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuT8YYAOOVI[a
   release candidate ], until the next version becomes available, MUST be used
   for building released binaries.
3. The latest version of Go SHOULD be used for release engineering.
4. https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master[`master`] MAY be used for
   development and is RECOMMENDED for ((Continuous Integration)) (CI) testing.
5. Use of `{gobin-1}` is RECOMMENDED in order to keep ``$GOPATH/bin``'s binaries
   in sync with that of the Go compiler.
6. Every time the version of `{go-1}` changes the contents of `$GOPATH/pkg` MAY
   be cleaned out:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ rm -rf $GOPATH/pkg/
----

[discrete]
=== Rationale

The Go team and project are consistently advancing the state of the Go compiler
and standard library.  Released versions and release candidates are considered
fit for production and should therefore be used in production.  Upgrade early
and often.

When release candidates are available, they should be used until the next
finalized release is made available.

The Go team and contributors have a good track record of advancing the state of
the compiler in terms of stability and performance.  Tendencies toward risk
aversion frequently have a higher cost (e.g. security, correctness, performance,
or stability) than absorbing the cost of any incremental upgrade.

Use of https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master[`master`] is not peril free,
however it does provide a good way of staying current and doesn't typically
cause much grief during development.  Use of
https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master[`master`] MAY improve correctness and
quality.

The version of `{go-1}` may be tightly coupled with binaries located in
`$GOPATH/bin` (especially those binaries who either walk the Go AST or interact
with other `{go-1}` tooling).  `{gobin-1}` automatically rebuilds `$GOPATH/bin`
binaries who are out of date with respect to the version of the `{go-1}`
compiler used.  Because Go developer tools tend to be written in Go and
necessarily coupled to the version of `{go-1}`, rebuilding `$GOPATH/bin`
binaries every time `{go-1}` is updated is RECOMMENDED.

The cached archive files in `$GOPATH/pkg` are explicitly tightly coupled with
`{go-1}` but starting in Go 1.5, `{go-1}` now maintains a
https://github.com/golang/go/commit/7b87631e8c41b7919a3a3a845b61cb7c240efff9[package
version] in order to automatically detect and trigger the rebuild
packages.footnoteref:[gopath-tmp,Cleaning out `$GOPATH/pkg` is an ounce of
prevention whose tiny cost is worth more than the pound of debugging.  Post Go
1.5 I've heard a handful of anecdotal reports of this fixing some extremely
unlikely and inexplicable panics that gets cleared up after `$GOPATH/pkg` has
been preened.  It's unclear if this is true, rare, a myth, or a scapegopher for
something else.]

Use of tools like `{vg-1}` MAY be useful or considered in the future but are NOT
REQUIRED: most of these recommendations are intended to aid productivity and
decrease friction, not constrain how someone goes about working.

[[project-structure,reftext=project-structure]]
Project Structure
-----------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. `$GOPATH` SHOULD be set to `$HOME/go` and SHOULD be incorporated into your
   shell's environment.
2. All development SHOULD be done within `$GOPATH/src`.
3. `$GOPATH/bin` SHOULD be part of `PATH` and before `/usr/local` or
   `/opt/local` (i.e. before system or package manager managed binaries).
+
-------------------------------
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
$ export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
-------------------------------
4. Where appropriate, it is RECOMMENDED to make use of monolithic repositories
   (mono-repo).
5. Publicly consumable libraries or programs SHOULD be pushed to a distinct
   canonical public location and automatically synchronized to the internal
   codebase.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

////
wtf is vendoring/.  Define that files are being vendor/'ed.
////

Starting in Go 1.8, `{go-1}` defaulted to `$HOME/go` as its default `GOPATH`.  It
is not strictly necessary to set `GOPATH`, however it is still advised to make
this implicit default explicit.
https://github.com/mailru/easyjson/pull/132[Many] tools or pieces of software
test for the environment variable `GOPATH` instead of using using `go env
GOPATH`.

In Go 1.8, the Go project defaulted to `$HOME/go` as the default value for
`$GOPATH`. Use of one-workspace per project is counter-productive and
establishes a workflow that is orthogonal to the ethos of the prevailing Go
ecosystem. This isn't to say there are times where this is necessary
(i.e. clean-room verification or maintenance of `vendor/`), but the default
practice SHOULD be to work inside of a single `$GOPATH` workspace
footnote:[Tools similar to https://bazel.build/[bazel] could influence this
recommendation in the future however there are no plans to augment the workflow
presented by the `{go-1}` tool.].

Go's tooling makes it especially productive to move all libraries and programs
into the same codebase so that refactoring can commence in atomic units of
work. In particular, making sweeping changes via `{gofmt-1}` `-r` is easy to
accomplish in a single repository and commit. Breaking apart individual
libraries into discrete repositories fragments the codebase with no isolation
guarantees that Version Control System (VCS) doesn't already provide. Contrast
that with having all libraries and programs in the same codebase, it is now
possible to move the entire codebase forward in an atomic transaction
footnote:[Monorepos can be justified by either their productivity gains, by
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law[Parkinson's law], or by blurring
blurring the natural organizational lines stemming from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law[Conway's law] by embracing the
egalitarian nature of software.]. Additional arguments in support of monorepos
include:

of Go (Part 1)]

Publicly reusable components, however, SHOULD be discretely usable.

[[workflow,reftext=workflow]]
Workflow
--------

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

////
Explain explicitly why the Gerrit workflow is there and what's internal vs
external.
////

Engineer workflow changes based on whether or not you have write-privileges to
the target repository.

[[workflow-github-like]]

If you HAVE write access to a repository and it is Github-like:

1. Checkout the repository:
+
[source,shell]
-------------------------------------------
$ go get -d my.git.server/my_org/my_project
-------------------------------------------
2. Create a branch for your change:
+
[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------
$ cd $GOPATH/src/my.git.server/my_org/my_project
$ git checkout -b my-branch-name
------------------------------------------------
3. Commit your change(s):
+
[source,shell]
------------
$ git commit
------------
4. Push your change to `origin`:
+
[source,shell]
-----------------------------------
$ git push -u origin my-branch-name
-----------------------------------
5. Submit a Pull Request (PR).
6. You SHOULD obtain a review. For all changes deemed to be trivial this is not
   necessary, however the change MUST be made through a PR in order to to aid in
   a quick backout commit.
7. Automated regression tests MUST complete and pass.
8. If the velocity of change for the repository is low enough, a `CHANGELOG`
   entry for the project SHOULD be committed to the PR as the final step before
   merging the PR. If the velocity of the repository is too high, the
   `CHANGELOG` entry for the project MAY be added after the PR has been merged.
9. Merge the PR. If the history of the PR is messy with unhelpful commits
   (e.g. "fix typo", "update test"), perform a squash merge with a detailed,
   high-quality commit message that has been approved by the rest of the
   team. Detail that can't be expressed in the commit message should be outlined
   in code comments.
10. Pull the latest changes:
+
-----------------------------------------------
$ git checkout master && git pull origin master
-----------------------------------------------
11. Delete your local branch:
+
------------------------------
$ git branch -d my-branch-name
------------------------------
12. Delete your branch from the server (e.g. `my-branch-name`).

[[workflow-github-like-fork]]

If you do NOT HAVE write access to a repository the workflow is largely the same
except you MUST create a fork of the repository:

1. Checkout the original repository:
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------
$ go get -d -v my.git.server/my_org/my_project
----------------------------------------------
2. Fork the upstream repository to your individual user account.
3. Add the remote for your repository:
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------
$ cd $GOPATH/src/my.git.server/my_org/my_project
$ git remote add me my.git.server/my_user/my_project
----------------------------------------------------
4. Create a branch for your change:
+
[source,shell]
--------------------------------
$ git checkout -b my-branch-name
--------------------------------
5. Commit your change(s)
6. Push your change to `me`:
+
[source,shell]
-------------------------------
$ git push -u me my-branch-name
-------------------------------
7. A `CHANGELOG` entry SHOULD be incorporated into the PR unless the upstream
   project will write the `CHANGELOG` entry for you.
8. Submit a Pull Request (PR).
9. Wait for the upstream provider to merge your PR.
10. Pull the latest changes:
+
[source,shell]
------------------------
$ git checkout master
$ git pull origin master
------------------------
11. Delete your local branch:
+
[source,shell]
------------------------------
$ git branch -d my-branch-name
------------------------------

[[workflow-package-path]]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Work MUST be completed within the same directory as the upstream source and not
the path to your fork of an upstream module (i.e.  CORRECT:
`$GOPATH/src/my.git.server/upstream_org/my_project` WRONG:
`$GOPATH/src/my.git.server/my_user/my_project`).  Instead use the path of your
upstream source, but use a different `git remote` URL.
====

[[workflow-gerrit]]

If you HAVE write access to a repository and it is Gerrit:

1. Checkout the repository:
+
[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ git clone --origin gerrit https://my.git.server/my_org/my_project.git
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Create a branch for your change:
+
[source,shell]
--------------------------------
$ git checkout -b my-branch-name
--------------------------------
3. Commit your change(s):
+
[source,shell]
------------
$ git commit
------------
4. Push your change to `origin`:
+
[source,shell]
--------------------------------------
$ git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/master
--------------------------------------
5. You MUST obtain a review.
6. Automated regression tests MUST complete and pass.
7. A `CHANGELOG` entry MUST be committed to the PR as the final step before
   merging the PR.
8. Merge the PR. If the history of the PR is messy with unhelpful commits
   (e.g. "fix typo", "update test"), perform a squash merge with a detailed,
   high-quality commit message that has been approved by the rest of the
   team. Detail that can't be expressed in the commit message should be
   outlined in code comments.
9. Pull the latest changes:
+
[source,shell]
------------------------
$ git checkout master
$ git pull origin master
------------------------
10. Delete your local branch:
+
[source,shell]
------------------------------
$ git branch -d my-branch-name
------------------------------

[[style,reftext=style]]
Style
-----

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. All code MUST pass through `{gofmt-1}`. `{gofmt-1}` SHOULD be executed with
   the `-s` flag.
2. Lines SHOULD wrap at 80 characters.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

The particular brand of https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code[tribal fascism
that extends from `{gofmt-1-name}`] increases the overall productivity of the
entire Go community by creating a single dialect of Go that is universal across
projects, teams, and organizations. Being able to drop into any arbitrary Go
project, regardless of the copyright, and be able to understand the codebase
quickly is a universal boon.

The only observable consequence to adhering to `{gofmt-1}`'s set of style norms
is the cost of shedding the sentimental attachment to a preference for "my way
of doing things". Developing a personal or project-wide coding style takes
discipline to adhere to, an understanding of the style guide's rules (including
their rationale), and an eagle-eye to enforce. Investment in such skills and the
pride attached to that skill-set is near-zero in the Go community. Shedding
personal preference - justified or not - in favor of a prescribed doctrine is a
tangible hurdle to overcome.

[NOTE]
====
The computing industry has been well served by project-wide style
guidelines in part because this created a sufficiently high barrier to entry
which acted as a litmus-test to ensure tribal norms were understood and
communicated to new members of the tribe. With many of the original industrial
programming languages being riddled with undefined behavior (e.g. C or C++),
style guides helped communities of engineers ship more reliable code and with
fewer bugs because project-wide idioms had a tendency to be put in place for a
reason.

Even before `{go-1}` adopted `{gofmt-1}` to enforce Go's single-style guideline,
`ident(1)` existed as a crude tool for enforcing style (crude to the point that
`ident(1)` was eschewed because it was unable to perform at the levels required
for a developer tool). In no way should `clang-format(1)` or `clang-tidy(1)` be
lumped into the same league of correctness as `ident(1)` because
`clang-format(1)` and `clang-tidy(1)` footnote:[`clang-format(1)` SHOULD be
considered for C and C++ codebases alike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7JmdCfI__c[clang-format - Automatic formatting
for CXX] and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX_GhJ6BuWI&t=1605[code::dive 2016
conference – Chandler Carruth – Making CXX easier, faster and safer (part 1)].
] recreate the AST before rewriting code (vs the brute-force text-level
tokenization performed by most `ident(1)` implementations).



The value and merit of individual or project preferences with regards to the
artistry stemming from style guides has been eclipsed by the value generated
from participating in the open, code-sharing world of the Go Open Source
ecosystem. Go came into the world with a lack of legacy, fragmentation, or
tribalism and has largely remained an unfragmented community in large part due
to its fungability of both Go developers and code that can be readily shared
across either projects or organizations.
====

`{gofmt-1}` SHOULD be used in place of the `{go-1}` tool's `fmt` command
because:

1. `{gofmt-1}` supports the `-s` flag to
   https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/#hdr-The_simplify_command[simplify code where
   possible].
2. `go fmt` calls `{gofmt-1}`:
   https://github.com/golang/go/blob/af2ac47/src/cmd/go/internal/fmtcmd/fmt.go#L42-L71[src/cmd/go/internal/fmtcmd/fmt.go
   L42-L71]
3. `{gofmt-1}` supports programmatic rewriting of the code base via the `-r`
   flag.
4. Code SHOULD be fungible. Go's simple syntax, emphasis on readability, and
   "side-effect"-free code largely make this a reality.

Additional rationale is included in
https://talks.golang.org/2015/gofmt-en.slide[Robert Griesemer's talk on The
Cultural Evolution of gofmt].

[[developer-tools]]
== Developer Tools

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

The following tools are RECOMMENDED for development:

1. `{goimports-1}`:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
----
2. `{guru-1}`:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru
----
3. `{godoc-1}`:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc
----
4. `{gorename-1}`:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gorename
----
5. `{gomvpkg-1}`:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gomvpkg
----
6. `{gobin-1}`:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u github.com/rjeczalik/bin/cmd/gobin
----

[discrete]
=== Rationale

[discrete]
==== `{goimports-1-name}`

Manually maintaining https://golang.org/ref/spec#Import_declarations[`import`
declarations] is a tedious waste of time.  `{goimports-1}` gets this right 99% of
the time and increases productivity significantly once integrated into your
`$EDITOR`.  `{goimports-1}` does periodically get the package wrong when there
is ambiguity, but with a nudge in the right direction it doesn't go off the
rails again for a particular source file.

[discrete,]
==== `{guru-1-name}` [[guru-rationale]]

`{guru-1}` SHOULD be integrated into your `$EDITOR` because it enables quick,
authoritative traversal of codebases.  `{guru-1}` is a huge productivity bump
and can't have enough good things said about it.  Watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak97oH0D6fI[Navigating Unfamiliar Code with the
Go Guru] and read {guru-using-url}[Using Go Guru: an editor-integrated tool for
navigating Go code].  Spiritually `{guru-1}` could probably attribute a material
portion of its inspiration with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags[`ctags(1)`],
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cscope[`cscope(1)`], and
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXR_Cross_Referencer[LXR], however `{guru-1}` is
much more sophisticated.

The list of ``{guru-1}``s functionality includes (as of July 2017, and taken
from {guru-1-url}):

.Identifier Queries
`what`::
+
[quote]
____
The `what` query describes the current source position as rapidly as possible.
It is not intended to be invoked directly by the user, but it allows editors to
provide immediate feedback in the UI whenever the cursor position changes.  It
can be used to highlight all identifiers that are equivalent to current one.
____
`definition`::
+
[quote]
____
The `definition` query finds the declaration of the selected identifier.  In
some editors, it may jump the cursor directly to that location.
____
`referrers`::
+
[quote]
____
The `referrers` query finds references to the selected identifier, scanning all
necessary packages within the workspace.
____
`freevars`::
+
[quote]
____
The `freevars` query enumerates the free variables of the selection.  "Free
variables" is a technical term meaning the set of variables that are referenced
but not defined within the selection, or loosely speaking, its inputs.
____

.Type Queries
`describe`::
+
[quote]
____
The `describe` query shows various properties of the selected syntax: its
syntactic kind, the type of an expression, the value of a constant expression,
the size, alignment, method set, and interfaces of a type, the declaration of an
identifier, and so on.  You may `describe` almost any piece of syntax, and
`{guru-1}` will print all the useful information it can.
____
`implements`::
+
[quote]
____
The `implements` query shows interfaces that are implemented by the selected
type and, if the selected type is itself an interface, the set of concrete types
that implement it.  An implements query on a value reports the same information
about the expression’s type.  An `implements` query on a method shows the set of
abstract or concrete methods that are related to it.
____

.Call Graph Queries
`callees`::
+
[quote]
____
The `callees` query shows the possible call targets of the selected function
call site.  The cursor or selection must be within a function call expression;
the selection need not be exact.
____
`callers`::
+
[quote]
____
The `callers` query shows the possible callers of the function containing the
selection.
____
`callstack`::
+
[quote]
____
The callstack query shows an arbitrary path from the root of the call graph to
the function containing the selection.  This may be useful to understand how the
function is reached in a given program.
____

.Alias Queries
`pointsto`::
+
[quote]
____
The `pointsto` query shows the set of possible objects to which a pointer may
point.  It also works for other reference types, like slices, functions, maps,
and channels.
____
`whicherrs`::
+
[quote]
____
The `whicherrs` query reports the set of possible constants, global variables,
and concrete types that may appear in a value of type error.  This information
may be useful when handling errors to ensure all the important cases have been
dealt with.
____
`peers`::
+
[quote]
____
The `peers` query shows the set of possible sends/receives on the channel
operand of the selected send or receive operation; the selection must be a `+++<-+++`
token.
____

[discrete]
==== `{godoc-1-name}`

`{godoc-1}` SHOULD be installed in order to have quick access to formatted
documentation.  Before committing a new body of work, the documentation for the
package should be inspected.  A strong cofactor in determining the reusable
value of software is its documentation (see also:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect[network effect]).

[discrete]
==== `{gorename-1-name}` and `{gomvpkg-1-name}`

`{gorename-1}` SHOULD be used for renaming package, function, and method members
(i.e. `const`, `func`, `var`, and `type`).

While less commonly needed, `{gomvpkg-1}` SHOULD be used when moving packages
around because it updates the necessary `import` declarations in a given scope.


[discrete]
==== `{gobin-1-name}`

Use `{gobin-1}` to rebuild ``$GOPATH/bin`` is RECOMMENDED after every upgrade of
`{go-1}`.  Rebuilding `$GOPATH/bin` by hand is equally acceptable but tedius and
error prone.

[[editor-integration]]
== `$EDITOR` Integration

[discrete]
=== Recommendation [[editor-integration-recommendation]]

This section is NOT making a recommendation regarding any particular
`$EDITOR`.footnote:[See https://www.xkcd.com/378/[Real Programmers]
https://xkcd.com/1823/[Hottest Editors]] This section is, however making a
strong recommendation that your `$EDITOR` include the following interrogations in
order to aid in maximal productivity:

1. `{goimports-1}` is SHOULD be added as a save hook. `$EDITOR` instructions are
   found at: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports[].
2. `{guru-1}` SHOULD be integrated into your `$EDITOR` as a plugin. Binding
   "jump-to-definition" to an easy-to-access keybinding is strongly
   RECOMMENDED. Instructions can be found at
   {guru-using-url}[{guru-using-url}].  See <<guru-rationale,`{guru-1-name}`
   rationale>>.
3. `{gorename-1}` SHOULD be integrated into your `$EDITOR` as a plugin
   (instructions for
   https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el/blob/master/go-rename.el#L13-L17[emacs],
   https://github.com/fatih/vim-go[vim]).

Specific editor integrations (alphabetically sorted):

* `emacs` users SHOULD look at
  https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el[go-mode.el] and MAY OPTIONALLY
  investigate integrating https://github.com/nsf/gocode[gocode].  With
  `{guru-1}` installed, enabling `go-guru-hl-identifier-mode` is RECOMMENDED
  when navigating code.
* `JetBrains` users SHOULD look at https://www.jetbrains.com/go/[Gogland].
* `vim` users SHOULD look at https://github.com/fatih/vim-go[vim-go] and MAY
  OPTIONALLY investigate integrating https://github.com/nsf/gocode[gocode].

[discrete]
=== Rationale [[editor-integration-rationale]]

`$EDITOR` preferences and configuration is an intensely personal subject.
Integrating `gofmt -s -w $FILE` may be a benefit to your individual workflow.
Some people who use `emacs` really like
https://github.com/dougm/goflymake[`flymake` or `flycheck`] or
`go-guru-hl-identifier-mode`, whereas others don't like the extra background CPU
they incur.  The list above is both lightweight and common.  Additional
<<contributing,suggestions or tips to improve `$EDITOR` productivity are
welcome>>.

[[vendor-management]]
`vendor/` Management
--------------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. Forked and cached libraries in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz5-UB7g2uPBdOx-rw5t9MxJwkfpx90cqG9AFL0JAYo/edit#![`vendor/`] MUST be managed via the `{dep-1}` tool:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep   // <1>
$ dep status                                // <2>
$ dep ensure                                // <3>
$ dep ensure -update                        // <4>
$ dep init                                  // <5>
----
<1> Install `{dep-1}`
<2> {dep-1-url}#checking-the-status-of-dependencies[Checking the status of dependencies]
<3> {dep-1-url}#usage[`ensure`, the main subcommand]
<4> {dep-1-url}#updating-dependencies[Update Dependencies]
<5> {dep-1-url}#setup[`dep(1)` Setup]
2. In a monorepo, whomever wants to update the bits in `vendor/` and
   `Gopkg.lock` MAY update the version, however they MUST:
.. take responsibility for making the change (and updating code as necessary).
.. testing the change.
.. communicate the change with consumers of the library.
.. receive approval from teams receiving the update.
3. `Gopkg.toml` SHOULD NOT lock a version to a specific version without reason.
   Valid reasons include:
.. Upstream did in-fact change something that requires local attention *and* the
cost of fixing the change locally is currently too high.
.. Upstream did in-fact commit something that is materially broken and the cost
of fixing the bug upstream is too high.
4. Release CI runs MUST use the version specified in `Gopkg.lock`.
5. Non-release CI SHOULD be able to report vendor drift via `dep status`.  If
   the CI environment is safely isolated to the extent that you're willing to
   run uninspected code from upstream, `dep ensure -update` SHOULD be run and
   report breakage caused by upstream changes.
6. `vendor/` and `Gopkg.lock` SHOULD be updated regularly in order to prevent
   forklift upgrades.
7. https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#what-is-the-difference-between-gopkgtoml-the-manifest-and-gopkglock-the-lock[Understanding
   the difference between the `Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock` files] is REQUIRED.


[discrete]
=== Rationale

As of Gophercon 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LtMb090AZI[`{dep-1-name}`
is on track to becoming the community defacto `vendor/` management tool] (this
is also on track according to their
https://github.com/golang/dep/wiki/Roadmap[roadmap]). If a project is using
either https://github.com/tools/godep[`godep(1)`] or
https://github.com/kardianos/govendor[`govendor(1)`], please make plans to
upgrade to `{dep-1}`.

See also https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/281[] and the
https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md[`{dep-1-name}`
FAQ]. https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/docs/Gopkg.toml.md[`Gopkg.toml`
documentation] is RECOMMENDED reading, too.

CI automatically updating dependencies in non-release builds provides a
motivation for `vendor/` to more closely track the upstream's most recently
tagged version or `master`.  Tracking more frequent, small changes is less error
prone than large "#yolo updates."

WARNING: Confusingly named, `{dep-1}` is not the same as `godep(1)`.  `{dep-1}`
is the future, not `godep(1)`.

CAUTION: CI systems can only run `dep ensure -update` if the CI systems are
capable of running untrusted, foreign code (or some other compensating control
is in place).

[[naming-conventions]]
Naming Conventions
------------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendations

1. Go software SHOULD conform to the recommendations outlined in the following
   resources:
.. https://blog.golang.org/package-names[Package Names]
.. https://rakyll.org/style-packages/[Style guideline for Go packages]
.. https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#names[Effective Go]
.. https://blog.golang.org/organizing-go-code[Organizing Go Code]
.. https://talks.golang.org/2014/organizeio.slide[Organizing Go Code]
2. Package authors MAY deviate from these conventions IF they have sought
   feedback from engineers who have sufficient experience writing Go libraries.
3. When working with a forked copy of a package, package import paths MUST
   continue to use the canonical, public import path.  See
   <<workflow-package-path,comments in workflow>>.
4. Package aliases SHOULD be used when necessary and there are two libraries
   with the same package name.
5. Programs SHOULD NOT explicitly `import` a package into the current namespace
   (i.e. do not use `import . "lib/math" Sin`).
6. Programs MAY import a package for their side effects using the black
   identifier (i.e. a package's `init()` MUST run). For example:
+
[source,go]
----
include::examples/import_test.go[tags=!test]
----
<1> ``import``s `database/sql`
<2> Invoke's ``github.com/lib/pq``'s `init()` method because it
https://github.com/lib/pq/blob/dd1fe2071026ce53f36a39112e645b4d4f5793a4/conn.go#L44-L46[registers
itself] with the `sql` package.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

Naming is one of the hard things in software. The package semantics of Go help
with this dilemma and minimize the blast-radius of poorly chosen names.  With
tools like `{guru-1}` commonly in use, the practice of encoding extraneous type
and package information into variable names is non-idiomatic and frowned upon.
https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton-go/pull/19#issuecomment-308860337[The burden
for good naming and exported functions falls on library authors].

[[repository-names]]
Repository Names
----------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendations

1. Repositories that contain Go libraries that wrap APIs or where there are
   competing libraries written in different langauges MUST be prefixed with
   `go-`.
2. Repositories that house libraries whose only consumers are internal to Go
   SHOULD be prefixed with `go-`.
3. Go repositories whose primary consumer is a library, but who also contain a
   binary, SHOULD conform to the `go-mylib/cmd/mycmdname`.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

Repositories where the distinct possibility of a name conflict may arise should
be prefixed with the primary language in order to create a unique namespace.
Examples of this at Joyent include:

* https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/node-manta[`node-manta`]
* https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/python-manta[`python-manta`]
* https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/java-manta[`java-manta`]

In a different example where a library also contains a binary, such as
https://github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr[`go-sockaddr`].
https://github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr[`go-sockaddr`] the repository contains:

1. Two libraries/packages:
   https://github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr/blob/master/sockaddr.go#L1-L45[`sockaddr`]
   and its
   https://github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr/tree/master/template[`template`]
   package.
2. One binary:
   https://github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr/tree/master/cmd/sockaddr[`sockaddr(1)`]

Standalone binaries such as those referenced in the <<static-analysis>> section
are examples of standalone commands that do not need to be nested under a `cmd/`
subdirectory nor do they need to be prefixed with `go-` because of their domain.

[[api-stability]]
API Stability
-------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. APIs within a single project SHOULD use tightly-coupled function signatures.
2. Refactoring APIs within a single project SHOULD use ``{gofmt-1}``'s `-r` flag
   to migrate function signatures.
3. External APIs that are loosely coupled across projects AND potentially
   unstable SHOULD use `struct` inputs. For example:
+
[source,go]
--------------------------------
package mypkg
struct MyFuncInputs {
  ArgA string
  ArgB int
  ArgC bool
}
func MyFunc(args MyFuncInputs) {
  // ...
}
--------------------------------
+
on the caller's side:
+
[source,go]
-------------------------
mypkg.MyFunc(MyFuncInput{
  ArgA: "foo",
  ArgB: 0xba72,
  Argc: true,
})
-------------------------
4. Required arguments SHOULD be extracted from the input struct.
5. Optional arguments or parameters that are subject to change by the authors of
   the library SHOULD be included in the input struct in order to provide loose
   coupling between the library and its consumers.
6. Where input arguments are not reused across API calls, use of
   stack-initialized (e.g. `MyFuncInput{}`) input structs SHOULD be used (vs
   heap initialized, e.g. `&MyFuncInput{}`).

[discrete]
=== Rationale

Tightly coupled interfaces within the same project SHOULD be treated as local
where possible. The onus for maintaining the API MUST be on the author changing
the function signature. Tools that programmatically rewrite the codebase SHOULD
be employed to make the change. The entire change SHOULD be merged as a single
operation.  Sweeping mechanical changes SHOULD be committed independent of
either functional or behavioral changes.

External APIs that are loosely coupled where consumers of a library are apt to
not update all of their call sites need to acknowledge that it is a maintenance
cost to enforce tight coupling between a project and an external library. Use of
`struct` input arguments allows:

1. library maintainer to advance the functionality of their library
   independently
2. consumers of the library to update without fear of breaking their API

[NOTE]
====
This recommendation stems from the following hypothetical:

Imagine a function signature is:

[source,go]
----
func MyFunc(a string, b int) { /* ... */ }
----

and the authors of `MyFunc()` decide the function signature needs to be updated
to:

[source,go]
----
func MyFunc(a string, b int, c bool) { /* ... */ }
----

All consumers of `MyFunc()` must update to the new signature.  In some cases
this compile-time breakage may be desirable in order for ``MyFunc()``'s authors
to communicate a breaking change or semantic change that requires some level of
understanding by the consumer. In other cases, the authors of `MyFunc()` may
have added new functionality without changing the semantic meaning of the
contract API. In the latter case, adding functionality to `MyFunc()` requires
source-code level API flexibility with a permissive interfaces in order to
minimize the maintenance cost incurred by consumers.

This could be achieved by adding an additional variadic function argument:

[source,go]
----
MyFunc(a string, b int, args ...interface{}) { /* ... */ }
----

but that approach would require runtime checking of the variadic argument,
`args`, and would eschew compile-time safety guarantees (and subsequent
optimizations).  If the consumers of `MyFunc()` span team or organizational
boundaries, it is effectively impossible to force callers to update their
interface to match the new function signature.

This recommendation is to introduce a static function signature with an
"append-only input structure":

[source,go]
----
type MyFuncInputs struct {}
func MyFunc(ctxt context, dnode uint64, MyFuncInputs{}) {
  //
}
----

The function signature for `MyFunc()` can now be effectively frozen and stable
from the perspective of the consumers of the library.  ``MyFunc()``'s new
signature acknowledges that both `ctxt` and `dnode` are required arguments yet
still allows the library author to extend the API in the future by appending
members to the `MyFuncInputs struct`.
====

If an API is performance sensitive, this approach MAY NOT be appropriate. Use of
this technique is an exercise in forethought where the cost of maintenance
burdened by the author is weighed against the runtime performance impact of
passing an optional struct input to a function. It is difficult to imagine the
case where the execution cost of thousands of requests per second would outweigh
the engineering burden of maintaining a frequently updated or loosely coupled
interface that spans repositories.

This technique must adhere to similar rules as those suggested when
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#updating[updating a
protobuf message type], notably:

* `*Input` struct member names are permanent and MUST NOT change or have their
  meaning altered in a way that changes their contract.
* Obsolete `*Input` struct member names MUST:
  a. be automatically mapped to an updated struct member(s)
  b. ignored (a discouraged practice)
  c. removed thereby explicitly breaking any existing code
  d. never be reused for the life of the interface (and therefore the `*Input`
     struct.
+
A phased approach to evolving a `*Input` struct is an acceptable strategy.

Again, this is a recommended technique for providing stable interfaces where the
runtime and diminished readability has been weighed against the cost of
maintenance (most notably engineering time or runtime breakage).

[[static-analysis]]
Static Analysis
---------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendations

1. Use and integration of "baseline static analysis checks" SHOULD be integrated
   into the CI.
2. An inventory of "optional static analysis checks" is RECOMMENDED but not
   necessary for a second tier of checks to be added to list of suggested static
   analysis checks (e.g. "noisy, but useful" or "mostly accurate, but still
   throws false-positives").

[discrete]
=== Rationale

`reviewdog` stands out as a pragmatic way to
https://medium.com/@haya14busa/reviewdog-a-code-review-dog-who-keeps-your-codebase-healthy-d957c471938b[programmatically
raise the bar of quality within a given Go project] by automatically executing
and providing inline annotations in PRs with the results of baseline checks. If
a particular type of error occurs more than a few times, write a static analysis
check and incorporate it into `reviewdog`.

For offline development, use of `{gometalinter-1}` is RECOMMENDED:

[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter
$ gometalinter --install
----

Regardless of the tool, incorporating a baseline of static analysis of commonly
identified issues frees up reviewers to focus on the content of change versus
the mechanics of the change. Time invested in static analysis checks usually
pays dividends with respect to preventing bugs
(e.g. https://github.com/kyoh86/scopelint[`scopelint`],
https://golang.org/cmd/vet/#hdr-Shadowed_variables[`go tool vet --shadow`],
https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck[`errcheck`],
https://github.com/stripe/safesql[`safesql`],
https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/tree/master/cmd/staticcheck[`staticcheck`]),
reducing sub-optimal code (e.g.
https://github.com/gordonklaus/ineffassign[`ineffassign`],
https://github.com/mvdan/unparam[`unparam`]), or reducing engineering time
wasted pointing out nits that could be identified consistently by bots
(e.g. https://golang.org/cmd/vet/[`go vet`], https://github.com/walle/lll[`lll`

[[explicit-types]]
Explicit Types
--------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. Explicit types SHOULD be used within a project.
2. Libraries or public APIs MAY export types where it helps readability.
3. Where the meaning or intent of a fundamental type would benefit from explicit
   type checking by the compiler, explicit types SHOULD be used.
4. https://golang.org/ref/spec#Conversions[Type Conversions] SHOULD be deferred
   as long as reasonable.
5. Where explicitly typed variables are employed, the lifecycle of identifiers
   referencing underlying types SHOULD be reduced to the smallest reasonable
   scope possible.
6. Use of `{gorename-1}` to maintain `type` names is RECOMMENDED. The
   RECOMMENDED use of `{gorename-1}` extends to all package, function, and
   method members (i.e. `const`, `func`, `var`, and `type`).

[discrete]
=== Rationale

Go is an https://golang.org/ref/spec#Types[explicitly typed language].  The
compiler does not perform any implicit type conversions of
https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_identity[named types]. Exported functions,
``interface``s, and ``type``s SHOULD make use of explicit types in order to
enable the compiler to detect and enforce a package's specified type system. It
is NOT RECOMMENDED to deprive the compiler of the necessary type information it
requires in order to prevent developers from incorrectly and abusively
overloading Go's underlying types (e.g.  `string` vs `RandomStringID`, or
`uint64` vs `inode`).

As an example, a `string` SHOULD be thought of as an immutable
https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_types[slice of runes] that is missing its
type information (i.e. a `string` is a container, not a type).

Go's fundamental or underlying types (e.g. `string`, `int*`, `[]byte`) are
containers that crudely answer the question "how is a variable going to be
stored efficiently." Use of underlying types do not answer the question "what
bits are in a given container."
https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_declarations[Go does not permit any implicit
type conversions of named types].

Go's explicit type system prevents variables backed by the same underlying type
from fraternizing. Use of fundamental types at formal interface boundaries is
discouraged because use of variable names to indicate the intended use of a
variable is only enforced by the reader, not by the compiler. If variable names
are sufficient to guard against variable misues, you MAY rely on variable names
to convey type information.

Where type intent information SHOULD be enforced by the compiler, use of
explicit types is RECOMMENDED. The Go type system is a compile-time cost, not a
runtime cost. Use types.

Examples:

[source,go,numbered]
----
type ID string                // <1>
type ID uint64                // <2>
type CookieID string
type UUID []byte
type Index uint
type Key string
type Value string
type Lookup map[Key]Value
----
<1> `ID` may have started out as a `string`
<2> `ID` could be easily changed to a `uint64` and the consequences easily
observed.  NOTE: this wouldn't compile due to the `ID` identifier being reused
in the same package.

[[return-parameters]]
Return Parameters
-----------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. When deciding if a function or method should return an argument by value or
   pointer, returning a value SHOULD be your default position except in the
   following situations, in which case it is RECOMMENDED to return a pointer to
   a value:
.. the API contract you want to establish with the caller is to force them
   to deal with errors by returning `nil` AND the construction of the zero-value
   is onerous or expensive (i.e. return `""` for a string).
.. ownership of the variable may change throughout the course of the
   variable's life.
.. the expense of copying the variable is measurable.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

Go uses pass-by-value semantics and employs
http://www.agardner.me/golang/garbage/collection/gc/escape/analysis/2015/10/18/go-escape-analysis.html[variable
escape analysis].

Embrace the pass-by-value nature of Go, be productive, and let the compiler do
work for you.

* https://dhdersch.github.io/golang/2016/01/23/golang-when-to-use-string-pointers.html[When
  to use string pointers]

* https://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals[Go Slices: usage and
  internals]
* https://blog.golang.org/slices[Arrays, slices (and strings): The mechanics of
  'append']
* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/3SBKSFRVbWA/IArLsJi-xV4J[Using
  Pointers in Golang]

Much of the above reading was shamelessly borrowed from a
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20849911/move-semantics-in-golang#20856597[Stack
Overflow article] which is a good read on its own merits.

[[interface-receivers]]
Interface Receivers
-------------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. When deciding if a receiver should be a value or a pointer, a pointer SHOULD
   be used by default except in the following situations, in which case it is
   RECOMMENDED to use a value:
.. the value of the receiver is a simple underlying type (i.e. an `int`)
.. invocation of the given interface method SHOULD result in a copy of the
   receiver.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

This is simple: use a pointer to a receiver in nearly all cases. Item `1b` is
very rare in practice.

[source,go,numbered]
----
type Foo struct {
  bar string
}

// Baz assigns "bur" to f.bar.  Without the pointer, this the instance of Foo
// would have been copied and the assignment would have been not visible to
// the caller (a nice source of frustration when first learning Go).
func (f *Foo) Baz() {
  f.bar = "bur"
}
----

In practice, use of non-pointer receivers is limited to the following example:

[source,go,numbered]
----
type MyEnum int

func (e MyEnum) String() string {
  switch e {
  case 0:
    return "zero"
  case 1:
    return "one"
  default:
    return "something not one or zero"
  }
}

var myEnum MyEnum = 0
fmt.Println("%s", myEnum)
----

Where the important takeaway is that in `String()`, it doesn't matter if the
value is copied.

[[const]]
`const`
-------

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. Use of `const` is RECOMMENDED.
2. Create explicitly typed ``const``s is RECOMMENDED.
3. ``const``s with type information SHOULD should be exported (both the `type` and
   the `const` values).
4. Periodically using static analysis checks like
   https://github.com/jgautheron/goconst[goconst] is RECOMMENDED but OPTIONAL.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

By creating a `const`, you give the Go tooling an identifier which you can
search for referrers of the given `const`. See the `referrers` section of the
{guru-using-url}[Using Guru] document (this document SHOULD be _required_
reading).

[[bitmasks]]
== Bitmasks

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. Bitmasks SHOULD be created using `const` and `iota`.
2. Bitmasks SHOULD be explicitly typed.
3. The meaning of bits in a bitmask MAY change if it is documented in the
   interface that the meaning of individual bits may change.
4. The meaning of bits MUST NOT change if the bitmask is exported and the
   position of individual bits is part of the contract.
5. A new type, removal of the bitmask as a type, or other form of compile-time
   breakage MUST be introduced in order to communicate the change in behavior.
6. Manual manipulation of bitmasks SHOULD NOT be performed without explicitly
   named bits.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

Go provides a convenient trick to automatically creating bitmasks:

[source,go,numbered]
----
type MyBitmask int

const (
      FlagA MyBitmask = 1 << iota  // <1>
      FlagB                        // <2>
      FlagC                        // <3>
      FlagD                        // <4>
)
----
<1> `FlagA` == `0x01`
<2> `FlagB` == `0x02`
<3> `FlagC` == `0x04`
<4> `FlagD` == `0x08`

Leverage this trick.

[[documentation]]
Documentation
-------------

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. Projects MUST use `godoc(1)` to document their project.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

Read the https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code[Godoc: documenting Go
code] blog post.footnote:[It would be nice, however, if `{godoc-1}` supported a
richer markup like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[`asciidoc`].]

[[context]]
== Context

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. Projects MUST the https://golang.org/pkg/context/[context] pattern for
   passing state along request-scoped state information (e.g. `deadlines`,
   `cancelation signals`, or request-specific information).
2. Instances of `{stdlib-context-type}` SHOULD use the identifier name `ctxt`,
   however `ctx` MAY be used.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

Read the https://blog.golang.org/context[Go Concurrency Patterns: Context] blog
post.

`ctxt` is the most common identifier for `{stdlib-context-type}` in use.  Unless
there is a good naming conflict, `ctxt` is a good identifier to use that
unambiguously communicates intent.

[[signals-context]]
== Signal Handling and `{stdlib-context-pkg-name}`

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. Signal handling SHOULD incorporate `{stdlib-context-pkg}` where possible.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

`{stdlib-context-pkg}` is a good way to handle signals from the OS.  Go handles the
`sigprocmask(2)` and `sigaction(2)` so that signals are delivered to a single OS
thread.

[source,go]
----
include::examples/main/main.go[]
----
<1> Create a https://golang.org/pkg/context/#Background[`Background`]
    `{stdlib-context-pkg}`.
<2> Save the newly created `{stdlib-context-type}` and its cancelation function.
<3> Create a buffered channel in order to prevent the OS thread from blocking.
<4> Wire up ``SIGINT`` to be delivered to `sigCh`.
<5> Push a `defer` handler onto the stack to shutdown the signal handler and
    cancel anything hanging off of the `{stdlib-context-type}`.
<6> Disable the delivery of new signals to `sigCh`.
<7> Cancel the `{stdlib-context-type}` instance. Cancelation operations are
    idempotent (which makes the cancelation at callout #7 safe).
<8> Spin off a goroutine to catch and handle signals delivered to `sigCh`.
<9> Drain the signal from `sigCh`.
<10> Switch on the signal type (not necessary for this simple example, but
     imagine a single signal hanler that is also capable of responding to
     `SIGHUP`).
<11> Handle the `SIGINT`
<12> Cancellation handler for `powerNap()`

* {stdlib-context-pkg-url}#WithDeadline[`{stdlib-context-pkg-name}.WithDeadline`]

[[deadline-timers-and-timeouts]]
== Deadline Timers and Timeouts

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. In-process timers and timeouts MUST use `time.Duration`.
2. In-process timers and timeouts using the `context` package MUST use
   `context.WithTimeout`.
3. Inter-process timeout enforcement MUST communicate using an absolute time
   reference using `time.Time`.
4. Inter-process timeouts using the `context` package MUST use
   `context.WithDeadline`.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

////
TL;DR: Duration uses the monotonic clock, time.Time is wall-clock time.
Communicating across processes and over the network is best done using wall
clock time.  If you don't need to communicate it or don't need precision, use
time.Duration for timeouts.

https://golang.org/pkg/time/#hdr-Monotonic_Clocks[`time.Time` package uses
monotonic time].

[[grpc]]
== gRPC

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. {gRPC} SHOULD be preferred as the RPC framework for communicating between
   discrete Go processes locally or on the network.
2. JSON MAY be used as the RPC framework when necessary to interoperate with
   non- {gRPC} clients.

[discrete]
=== Rationale

Read the https://blog.golang.org/context[Go Concurrency Patterns: Context] blog
post.

[[pprof]]
== `{pprof-name}` and `{gops-1-name}`

[discrete]
=== Recommendation

1. Long-running daemons MUST have either a `{gops-1}` or `{pprof}` endpoint
   available on a secure endpoint (a loopback interface, the default, is
   considered a secure endpoint).
2. The `{gops-1}` endpoint is RECOMMENDED and can be added to code like:
+
[source,go]
----
include::examples/gops_test.go[tags=!test;**,indent=0]
----
<1> Import the `agent`
<2> Listen early on after configuration
3. The `{pprof}` endpoint SHOULD use a standardized URL anchors.
4. The `{pprof}` endpoint MAY be made available via alternate libraries other
   than the canonical `{net_http_pprof}` listener.  See <<agent>> for a
   RECOMMENDED way of enabling the `{pprof}` interface.  If <<agent>> CAN NOT be
   used, the following fragment is sub-optimal SHOULD NOT be used to create a
   local listener:
+
[source,go]
----
include::examples/net_http_pprof_bad_test.go[tags=!test;!main]
include::examples/net_http_pprof_bad_test.go[tags=main,indent=0]
----
<1> The `net/http` package is only needed for the standalone listener used in
    callout 5.
<2> Initialize the `net/http/pprof` package.
<3> `init()` SHOULD NOT be used to spawn this listener in order to allow for
    proper configuration to take place *and* to allow the program to respond to
    errors in the event the `{pprof}` endpoint fails to initialie.  The
    `{pprof}` endpoint SHOULD be initialized before this service enters its
    duty-cycle.
<4> Start a detached thread to handle `{pprof}` requests.
<5> Listen on a local endpoint and port
<6> "One second ought to be enough time for any service to fail."
+
[WARNING]
====
This is a _BAD_ example of how because: the code does not handle errors well;
assumes the listener will start and fail within one second, and this introduces
an arbitrary one second delay to program initialization. See the next example
for a preferred way of initializng the `{pprof}` endpoint which addresses each
of these concerns.  The example snippet in ``{net_http_pprof}``'s documentation
is convenient and uncomplicated but SHOULD NOT be used in production for the
aforementioned reasons.
====
////
+
If <<agent>> can not be used, the following is the preferred, more explicit way
to initialize `{net_http_pprof}` endpoint:
[source,go]
----
include::examples/net_http_pprof_test.go[tags=!test;!main]
include::examples/net_http_pprof_test.go[tags=main,indent=0]

[appendix,id="go-intro"]
== Go 101 Resources

If you are completely new to Go, "I haven't written a line of Go in my life
before today," this section is a quick primmer to get you up and running in a
hurry.

=== Five Minute Jump Start

Suppose you know nothing and just need to get started.  The following steps
SHOULD get you to a functioning "Hello World" in ~5min.

. https://golang.org/doc/install[Install a stable copy of Go].  This can be done
  in a number of ways, either from the https://golang.org/dl/#stable[official
  Download Page] or via your preferred package management system:
.. https://pkgsrc.smartos.org/[`pkgsrc`]: `sudo pkgin -y install go`
.. https://www.macports.org/[MacpPrts]: `sudo port install go`
.. https://brew.sh/[Homebrew]: `sudo brew install go`
. Open a terminal and add the following environment variables to your shell
  (as long as your `GOPATH` is set and `PATH` includes `$GOPATH/bin` at the end
  of this step how you get this done doesn't matter):
+
[source,shell]
----
$ echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> ~/.profile
$ echo 'export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
$ export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
----
. Ensure `{git-1}` has already been installed.
. Install `{gometalinter-1}`: `go get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter`
. Install ``{gometalinter-1}``'s linters: `gometalinter --install`
. Install `{gops-1}`: `go get -u github.com/google/gops`
. Install `{expvarmon-1}`: `go get -u github.com/divan/expvarmon`
. Install `{go-torch-1}`: `go get -u github.com/uber/go-torch`
. Install `{flamegraph-1}`: `go get -d github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph`
. Add ``{flamegraph-1}``'s scripts to your `PATH`: `export
PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph`
. Change into an existing sample program: `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/gops/examples/hello`
. Edit `main.go` and make the following edits:

It's obviously not required to step through and enumerate all of the
capabilities of `{gops-1}` and the `{pprof}` endpoints when writing a "Hello
World" app but it shows off some of the built-in capabilities.  Additional
information is covered in the section on <<pprof,`pprof`>>.

=== Books

The following is a list of books that people have found helpful for getting
started.  One of the problems with learning by dead tree is the disparity
between inches of shelf-space occupied to a given subject versus the mental
real-estate a given subject occupies.  Because a language feature is address -
sometimes at length - doesn't mean it is a primary concern or something you need
to become a subject-matter expert on.

==== Recommended Resources

The following are "approved" resources ("approved" in this context only means
"this wasn't awful and will point you in the right direction" and doesn't
constitute as a explicit endorsement #JoyentEmployee).  There may be other good
resources that exist, but they haven't been reviewed (pull requests welcome).

[[make]]
=== `{make-1-name}`

`{make-1}` comes in many shapes and forms.  {make-gnu-1-url}[GNU
`{make-gnu-1-name}]` is the predominant `{make-1}` implementation.
{make-gnu-1-url}[GNU `{make-gnu-1-name}`], however, has its own dialect and its
dialect is not universally supported.  If you use GNU
``{make-gnu-1-name}``-specific extensions, you MUST spell the `Makefile` like
`GNUmakefile`.  The same rule applies to {make-bsd-1-url}[BSD
`{make-bsd-1-name}`] and `Makefile`.footnoteref:[bmake-makefile,Irritatingly
enough, `.MAKE.MAKEFILE_PREFERENCE` does not default to using `BSDmakefile` in
its preference list by default.] It is unfortunate that there is poor
interopoerability between the various `{make-1}` implementations and it's
equally unfortunate that the prevailing attitudes is to be conformist (versus
taking a zero-cost principled stand for correctness).

[source,shell]
----
$ cat GNUmakefile
test:
    echo $(shell echo bar)
$ bsdmake -f GNUmakefile
echo

$ gnumake -f GNUmakefile
echo bar
bar
----

In the end, this fragmentation has led many to adopt `{make-1}` as the universal
human UX and system interoperability layer to front tools like `{bezel-1}` or
`{goreleaser-1}`.

[NOTE]
====
`{make-1}` is like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin[Latin].  Many western
languages decend from `{make-1}`, however no one speaks Latin anymore.  Instead
people speak Spanish, Italian, French, English, etc.  If you don't speak French
and call it Latin, I won't speak Spanish and call it Latin.  Incorrectness has
consequences.  In software it most oftens in deferred cost.
