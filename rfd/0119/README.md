# RFD 119 Routing Between Fabric Networks

<!--
TODO:
- need dcapi for coordinating who's in a region
- fill out SVP changes
- describe overlay(5) implementation more
-->

## Problem Statement

Today, Triton Fabric Networks are self-contained. A customer can create a
network using an RFC 1918 subnet, provision instances on it, and have them
communicate using their fabric addresses. They can create additional networks
with disjoint prefixes, but they cannot reach with each other.

We would like to allow customers to configure routes between networks so that
they can pass their traffic between networks as needed.

## Proposed Solution

A new attribute, the `attached_networks` attribute, will be added to NAPI's
network object. It will be an array of Triton network UUIDs that VMs on the
network are able to route to. (For people moving from AWS, this is akin to a
VPC Route Table.) For now, only fabric networks owned by the same customer on
the same DC will be allowed to be attached to a fabric network, but with the
introduction of Remote Network Objects (see [RFE 2] and [RFD 130]) and
someday AUTHAPI (see [RFD 48]), cross-customer, cross-DC, and non-Triton
peers can be reachable as well.

### NAPI Changes

#### Connecting Networks

NAPI fabric networks will now have a new property: `attached_networks`.  The
`attached_networks` property consists of an array of network UUIDs. The
networks must be owned by same owner as the containing fabric network. When a
network has other networks attached to it, we will adjust the `"routes"` table
to include entries for each attached subnet. (Using static routes for each
destination subnet interacts more nicely with existing instances that have a
primary NIC on the internet and are using its gateway as their default route.)

There are two classes of fabric networks that can be attached to a network
and affect the routes that get created for it. There are fabrics that are
located on the same Virtual Layer 2 (VL2) network (same datacenter, same VNET
identifier, and same VLAN identifier), and there are fabrics that are located
on a separate VL2, possibly in another datacenter.

The first class of networks can be made to work today with some manual
configuration on the part of the customer. For these networks, we will return
`"linklocal"` in the `"routes"` object to indicate that they can be treated
like they are on the same virtual segment. (See [TRITON-265] and [TRITON-266]
for supporting interface routes in Triton.)

When attaching to the second class of networks, NAPI will select an IP
address from the source network, save it in the `"overlay_router"` field, and
use it as the next-hop address in the `"routes"` object. This IP address will
be mapped in Portolan to a designated MAC address recognized by the overlay
devices. (See the Overlay Changes section for more here.)

When fetched from NAPI, the field will look something like:

```
# sdc-napi /networks/03b9302a-0e4f-471c-8f21-2a46173b15bd | json -H
{
  ...
  "attached_networks": [
    "f4104070-df1e-4c4a-891c-58951abd72e8",
    "103b4f01-b8bc-42a5-886a-0a680da22d20",
    "b1963383-6b1a-4025-b73d-a7fb43ff7624"
  ],
  ...
}
```

Note that when a Triton network appears in an `"attached_networks"` array,
then it will also contain its own mirroring `"attached_networks"` entry, to
guarantee that two networks are always mutually routable and help prevent
users from accidentally configuring a network to pass traffic in one
direction but forgetting to do so in the other.  Remote Networks (see next
section) that are not Triton instances may not be able to provide similar
guarantees about network knowledge.

Since attaching networks together requires changes to instance routing tables,
the work for this RFD will depend on the [RFD 28] work being done, too.

### Representing Remote Networks Locally

In the future `"remote"` may be used to indicate other kinds of remote
networks, possibly reachable through some kind of authenticated tunnel or
other method.  Remote Network Objects are discussed in more depth in [RFD
130].

### Overlay Changes

Currently the SmartOS [overlay(5)] device works with `varpd` and its SDC VXLAN
Protocol (SVP) plugin to determine where MAC addresses live. The SVP plugin
communicates with Portolan to resolve overlay IPs (VL3 addresses) to overlay
MACs (VL2 addresses), and the VL2 addresses to underlay addresses (UL3). This
information gets cached in the kernel for future packets.

To expand this to include attached fabric networks, we will use a designated
MAC address to determine whether we need to inspect the destination IP
address (which we can then use to find the UL3 information), how we need to
rewrite the VL2 information, and what VLAN identifier to use for the
destination fabric. This includes the source MAC address to match the
designated MAC address being used on the destination fabric network. This MAC
address is assigned to the `"overlay_router"` IP address mentioned earlier.

To help the SVP plugin, we will pass additional arguments to `create-overlay`
(which currently come from booter):

- `svp/router_oui`, the prefix used in the fabric router MAC address

### Portolan and SVP Protocol Changes

Portolan will need to be informed by NAPI what a network is allowed to route
to, so that it can supply the information needed by [overlay(5)].

This will involve an increment of the SVP protocol version from 1 to 2.  With
one exception, version 1 messages will work as they did before in version 2.
For version 2, we will introduce two new message types, `SVP_ROUTE_REQ` and
`SVP_ROUTE_ACK`:

```
{ "name": "struct svp_route_req", "struct": [
		{ "name": "srr_vnetid", "type": "uint32_t" },
		{ "name": "srr_vlanid", "type": "uint16_t" },
		{ "name": "srr_pad", "type": "uint8_t [2]" },
		{ "name": "srr_srcip", "type": "uint8_t [16]" },
		{ "name": "srr_dstip", "type": "uint8_t [16]" }
] },
{ "name": "struct svp_route_ack", "struct": [
		{ "name": "sra_status", "type": "uint32_t" },
		{ "name": "sra_dcid", "type": "uint32_t" },
		{ "name": "sra_vnetid", "type": "uint32_t" },
		{ "name": "sra_vlanid", "type": "uint16_t" },
		{ "name": "sra_port", "type": "uint16_t" },
		{ "name": "sra_ul3ip", "type": "uint8_t [16]" },
		{ "name": "sra_vl2_srcmac", "type": "uint8_t [6]" },
		{ "name": "sra_vl2_dstmac", "type": "uint8_t [6]" },
		{ "name": "sra_src_prefixlen", "type": "uint8_t" },
		{ "name": "sra_dst_prefixlen", "type": "uint8_t" }
] },

```

#### SVP_ROUTE_REQ

| Field      | Type        | Description            |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| srr_vnetid | uint32_t    | Source VNET id         |
| srr_vlanid | uint16_t    | Source VLAN id         |
| srr_pad    | uint8_t[2]  | Padding                |
| srr_srcip  | uint8_t[16] | Source IP address      |
| srr_dstip  | uint8_t[16] | Destination IP address |



#### SVP_ROUTE_ACK

| Field             | Type       | Description                         |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| sra_status        | uint32_t   | Status Code                         |
| sra_dcid          | uint32_t   | Destination datacenter id (future)  |
| sra_vnetid        | uint32_t   | Destination VNET id                 |
| sra_vlanid        | uint16_t   | Destination VLAN id                 |
| sra_port          | uint16_t   | Destination UL port                 |

| sra_vl2_srcmac    | uint8_t[6] | Source VL MAC address               |
| sra_vl2_dstmac    | uint8_t[6] | Destination VL MAC address          |
| sra_src_prefixlen | uint8_t    | Source VL subnet prefix length      |
| sra_dst_prefixlen | uint8_t    | Destination VL subnet prefix length |



#### SVP_ROUTE operation

When portolan receives an `SVP_ROUTE_REQ`, it will query the
`portolan_vnet_routes` [moray bucket] for all objects containing the
combination of `srr_vnetid,srr_vlanid`.  It will then check each matching
object to see if the `srr_srcip` and `srr_dstip` are included in the object's
`subnet` and `r_subnet` respectively.  If a match is found portolan will fill
out the `SVP_ROUTE_ACK` message and return it to the caller.



#### Shootdowns

The SVP_R_LOG_REQ command will include, for version 2, SVP_LOG_ROUTE
data, in addition to version 1's SVP_LOG_VL2 and SVP_LOG_VL3.

```

| svlr_pad           | uint16_t    | Padding for alignment     |

### Platform Changes

* In order to make the impact of attaching networks more immediate, we will
  update the routing table for OS and LX zones at the time of `vmadm update`,
  instead of waiting for the next reboot. (See [OS-6817] and [OS-6818].)
