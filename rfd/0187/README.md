# RFD 187 AI Contributions to Triton

## Definitions of Terms

AI - Artificial Intelligence. In this document this term will be used to refer to "generative AI" such
as large language models (LLMs). Commercial examples include ChatGPT from OpenAI and Claude from Anthropic.
This document intends to cover both use of commercially available tools as well as locally run ones (e.g.
running a Llama model using ollama).

## Problem statement

If we allow contributions to our repositories that were produced using AI tools, we believe
that we need to keep track of them. While many of these tools will credit themselves in commit
messages, our squash-and-merge processes in many of our repos mean we need a plan for how
to preserve that attribution in the commits that land on our production branches.

## Proposed Solution

### Attribution

- The unit of work that we land is a peer-reviewed GitHub pull request.
- Only humans count as peer reviewers for approving and merging pull requests.
- A human proposing a PR with AI generated content is expected to fully understand that content and must review it with extra scrutiny for correctness, security, and adherence to project standards.
- A PR with ANY AI generated content MUST credit the AI tool(s) used, regardless of the size or significance of the contribution.
- For repositories where branches are merged preserving the original commits
  - Commits where the tool credits itself are great. As author or co-author are both acceptable.
  - If the commit message is being written by a human, make sure to credit the tool appropriately.
- For repositories where we "squash and merge" down to a single commit
  - The applied commit message MUST contain an attribution line. We will use `Portions generated by: ` followed by
    an appropriate attribution.
  - For tools with standardized name and email-addresses, e.g. Claude Code, we will use the string the tool uses.
    - `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
  - For tools without standard attribution formats, use the tool name and version when available.
    Examples could include: `ChatGPT-4`,  `ollama/llama3.1`, `GitHub Copilot`, etc.

### Acceptable Use

- Generating unit tests
- Generating documentation
- Translating existing code from one language to another

**Development Support:**
- Generating boilerplate code (e.g., struct definitions, basic CRUD operations)
- Creating mock data or fixtures for testing
- Generating configuration file templates
- Writing repetitive code patterns (e.g., error handling, logging)

**Code Quality:**
- Refactoring existing code for readability (with human review)
- Adding error handling to existing functions
- Generating code comments and inline documentation
- Creating example usage code for APIs or libraries

**Analysis and Debugging:**
- Generating debugging scripts or diagnostic tools
- Creating log parsing utilities
- Writing code analysis scripts (linting rules, metrics collection)
- Generating sample reproduction cases for bugs

**Maintenance:**
- Updating deprecated API usage patterns
- Converting between data formats
- Creating migration utilities for data structure changes
- Generating compatibility shims

### Legal and Licensing Considerations

**Licensing Compatibility:**
- AI-generated code may not have clear copyright ownership
- Ensure AI-generated content is compatible with existing project licenses
- Some licenses may require specific attribution or have restrictions on derivative works

**Intellectual Property:**
- AI models trained on copyrighted code could potentially reproduce similar patterns
- Risk of inadvertent copyright infringement through AI suggestions
- Patent implications for AI-generated implementations

**Liability:**
- Contributors remain responsible for AI-generated code that causes issues
- Standard warranty and indemnification considerations apply
- Insurance implications should be considered for AI-assisted development

**Compliance:**
- Some industries or contracts may prohibit or restrict AI-generated code
- Export control considerations for AI-generated cryptographic implementations
- Data sovereignty issues if AI tools process sensitive information

**Recommendation:** Consult with legal counsel when in doubt about AI-generated content, particularly for security-critical components or when working under specific contractual obligations.

### Unacceptable Use

**Security/Safety:**
- Generating cryptographic implementations, key generation, or security-critical code
- Code that handles authentication, authorization, or access control
- Network security protocols or firewall rules

**Legal/Compliance:**
- Code that could infringe on patents or copyrights
- Generating entire functions/modules that might be substantially similar to existing copyrighted code
- Code that processes personal data without proper privacy considerations

**Quality/Reliability:**
- Production database migration scripts or schema changes
- Code that directly manipulates critical system state without human review
- Performance-critical code paths without benchmarking/validation

**Architectural:**
- Core system architecture decisions (API design, data models, etc.)
- Code that establishes new dependencies or external integrations
- Changes to build systems, CI/CD pipelines, or deployment processes

**Context-Specific:**
- Code that requires deep domain knowledge of Triton's specific architecture
- Modifications to existing complex algorithms without understanding the original intent
- Code that interfaces with hardware or low-level system components

### Examples

- Commit message of a human crediting Claude: https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton-moirai/pull/4/commits/36ee26c3700cc74aa730489abc1779b0de724c01
- Commit from Claude: https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton-moirai/pull/4/commits/87d42eb21886ae2ad9877621bd1144a975ae40db
- Commit from Claude with Claude as author: https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/rfd/pull/159/commits/a75057c51b8515eb153105ad133b7df7dcee5b3e
- Squashed commits from Claude with model details added manually: https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton-moirai/pull/4/commits/dd12c0a18b2334fc56926d29659c7923d3c68c63
