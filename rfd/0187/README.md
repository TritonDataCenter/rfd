# RFD 187 AI Contributions to Triton

## Definitions of Terms

AI - Artifical Intelligence. In this document this term will be used to refer to "generative AI" such
as large language models (LLMs). Commercial exmaples include ChatGPT from OpenAI and Claude from Anthropic.
This document intends to cover both use of commercially available tools as well as locally run ones (e.g.
running a Llama model using ollama).

## Problem statement

If we allow contributions to our repositories that were produced using AI tools, we believe
that we need to keep track of them. While many of these tools will credit themselves in commit
messages, our squash-and-merge processes in many of our repos mean we need a plan for how
to preserve that attribution in the commits that land on our production branches.

## Proposed Solution

### Attribution

- The unit of work that we land is a peer-reviewed GitHub pull request.
- Only humans count as peer reviewers for approving and merging pull requests.
- A human proposing a PR with AI generated content is expected to fully understand that content.
- A PR with AI generated content MUST credit the AI tool(s) used.
- For repositories where branches are merged preserving the original commits
  - Commits where the tool credits itself are great. As author or co-author are both acceptable.
  - If the commit message is being written by a human, make sure to credit the tool appropriately.
- For repositories where we "squash and merge" down to a single commit
  - The applied commit message MUST contain an attribution line. We will use "Portions generated by: " followed by
    an appropriate attribution.
  - For tools with standardized name and email-addresses, e.g. Claude Code, we will use the string the tool uses.
    - "Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Acceptable Use

- Generating unit tests
- Generating documentation
- Translating existing code from one language to another

### Unacceptable Use

- TBD

### Examples

- Commit message of a human crediting Claude: <https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton-moirai/pull/4/commits/36ee26c3700cc74aa730489abc1779b0de724c01>
- Commit from Claude: <https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton-moirai/pull/4/commits/87d42eb21886ae2ad9877621bd1144a975ae40db>
- Squashed commits from Claude with model details added manually: <https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton-moirai/pull/4/commits/dd12c0a18b2334fc56926d29659c7923d3c68c63>

Example of a commit message for a squashed commit where Claude was used:
