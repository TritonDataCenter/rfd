# Project manifest

The project manifest defines all the services of a project, as well as other details that may be added in time. Each project has a single active manifest that defines the expected state of the entire project.

The `tags` fields is optional. If provided, these manifest tags will be accessible via the Triton CLI, and able to be filtered upon in project list operations. 

```yaml
defaults:
    network: <network name>
    public_network: <network name or uuid>
tags:
    - <tag name> = <tag value>
    - <tag name> = <tag value>
    - <tag name> = <tag value>

[Reference the service manifest documentation](../service/manifest.md) for services details.

Additional object types that might be expected in future iterations of the project manifest include [network fabrics](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/network/sdn), [firewall rules](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/network/firewall), CNS domains, [RFD26 volumes](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/blob/master/rfd/0026/README.md), and Manta storage "buckets".


## Manifest format

Though JSON is the preferred data interchange format throughout Triton, the inability to support inline comments has proven challenging in ContainerPilot. Those comments are more than a convenience, they're critically needed for inline documentation. This is especially true in operations where small changes can make the difference between smooth running and miserable disaster.

Given that, the default format for the project and service manifest is YAML, and efforts should be made to preserve in their entirety the valid, YAML-formatted manifest file submitted by the user.
