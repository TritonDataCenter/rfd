# RFD 14 Signed ZFS Send

## Introduction

The ZFS send stream format is a convenient and efficient way to synchronize and
replicate ZFS filesystems, whether to another live system or to backup media.
However, the stream format and the code that parses it in `zfs receive` were
never designed to allow the processing of arbitrary untrusted data.

The stream format is a wrapper around series of DMU-layer records which are only
validated in very simple ways before being written directly into the receiving
ZFS pool. This means it is possible for streams to contain DMU records that
contain data which violate invariants assumed by the upper layers of ZFS (such
as the ZPL). Such data would be blindly written into the pool by `zfs receive`,
making it potentially un-importable (and possibly resulting in a kernel panic,
and worse, allowing for the corruption of other data in the pool).

One way to mitigate the problem somewhat is to enable administrators to make
trust decisions based on the origin of a given ZFS send stream. In this
document, we propose an enhancement to the stream format to allow the use of
cryptographic signatures to verify the origin of a stream.

### Send stream record structure

The ZFS send stream format consists of a wrapper (generated in userland), around a series of "DMU replay records", which are generated by the kernel.

DMU replay records consist of a header (a `dmu_replay_record_t`) followed by a
`payload`. The generic structure of a record looks like:

<!--
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.25em]{64}
\bitheader{0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64} \\
\begin{rightwordgroup}{header}
    \bitbox{32}{drr\_type} \bitbox{32}{drr\_payloadlen} \\
    \wordbox{3}{drr\_u \\ (272 bytes)} \\
    \wordbox{1}{drr\_checksum (32 bytes)}
\end{rightwordgroup} \\
\wordbox[lrt]{2}{payload \\ (drr\_payloadlen bytes)} \\
\skippedwords \\
\wordbox[lrb]{1}{}
\end{bytefield}
-->
![dmu_replay_record_t](https://rawgit.com/joyent/rfd/master/rfd/0014/dmu_replay_record.svg)

The `drr_u` member is a union containing the specific fields for each type of
record (types include `drr_object`, `drr_write`, `drr_spill` and some others).
All of these fit in the 272 available bytes between `drr_payloadlen` and
`drr_checksum`.

Size of used space in various types' `drr_u` values:

| Type                 | Size (bytes) |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| `drr_freeobjects`    | 24           |
| `drr_free`           | 32           |
| `drr_object`         | 40           |
| `drr_write_embedded` | 48           |
| `drr_spill`          | 56           |
| `drr_write`          | 88           |
| `drr_write_byref`    | 104          |

At the beginning and end of a stream are two special records, the `drr_begin`
and `drr_end`. These records are considered special because neither of them have
the usual `drr_checksum` member (`drr_end` does have one, but not at the usual
offset). Also, `drr_end` must have `drr_payloadlen` set to zero, and no trailing
payload.

The `drr_checksum` members of ordinary records contain the 4th-order Fletcher checksum (also known as the "ZFS Fletcher-4" or "fletcher4") of all the bytes in the stream so far up to that `drr_checksum`. The `drr_end`'s checksum member contains the checksum of all bytes up until the beginning of the `drr_end` record.

![checksum structure](https://rawgit.com/joyent/rfd/master/rfd/0014/checksums.svg)

This system of incremental checksums has many desirable properties -- it allows
for each record to be checksummed on the fly, while also checksumming the total
contents and order of the stream.

### Cryptographic signatures

Digital cryptographic signatures are commonly used to verify both the integrity
and the authenticity of some array of bytes. The way in which they do this takes
advantage of public-key cryptography. While a full introduction to public-key
cryptography is beyond the scope of this document, public-key algorithms allow
the creation and use of a key that is in two parts: a "public" key and a
"private" key. Data that has been encrypted with the "public" key can only be
decrypted with the "private" key, and vice versa.

In a public-key digital signature scheme, conceptually, you keep the "private"
key to yourself while sharing the "public" key with all of your users. Then, you
can take a secure hash of some content and encrypt it with your private key.
Your users can easily decrypt the hash with your public key that you have shared
with them, and be assured that if the data's hash as they compute it matches the
decrypted hash, then the data originated from you (since nobody else has the
private key).

While this is not quite the way in which real signature schemes work, it does
suffice to illustrate the broad concept. The signature consists of information
derived from the content and your private key, and can be easily verified with
your public key, but cannot be easily forged without having your private key at
hand.

Generally, both keys and signatures are a small collection of large numbers (256
to 4096 or more bits in length, depending on algorithm). The following table
shows typical sizes of some signatures for common public-key algorithms:

| Algorithm                          | Signature size                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| RSA (4096 bit key)                 | 512 bytes (1x key-sized number)    |
| RSA (2048 bit key)                 | 256 bytes (1x key-sized number)    |
| DSA (1024 bit key)                 | 256 bytes (2x key-sized numbers)   |
| ECDSA on NIST P-256 (256 bit key)  | 64 bytes (2x key-sized numbers)    |
| ECDSA on NIST P-384 (384 bit key)  | 96 bytes (2x key-sized numbers)    |
| EdDSA on Curve25519 (256 bit key)  | 64 bytes (1x 2x-key-sized number)  |

## Design proposal

Notice that, based on the above table and the structure of the DMU stream record
headers, there is enough space left in the existing `dmu_replay_record_t` (168
bytes) to accommodate either an ECDSA or EdDSA signature. In fact, after adding
a 64-byte signature there would still be 104 remaining padding bytes in the
largest of the record types (`drr_write_byref`).

It is desirable to keep the overall size of the `dmu_replay_record_t` unchanged,
as this allows for much simpler compatibility with both previous and future
versions of the stream format.

To allow easy identification of the keypair that was used to sign the records,
we should also include a "key fingerprint" (a hash of the public key) and an
identifier for the algorithms used, in the stream. Rather than including these
on each record, though, they will be kept in the nvlist following the
`drr_begin` record, as other forms of extensible metadata already are (such as
that belonging to resumable send streams).

The proposed modified `dmu_replay_record_t` structure (for EdDSA on 25519, ECDSA 256-bit curve, etc):

<!--
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.25em]{64}
\bitheader{0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64} \\
\begin{rightwordgroup}{header}
    \bitbox{32}{drr\_type} \bitbox{32}{drr\_payloadlen} \\
    \wordbox{3}{drr\_u \\ (208 bytes)} \\
    \wordbox{4}{drr\_signature \\ (64 bytes)} \\
    \wordbox{2}{drr\_checksum (32 bytes)}
\end{rightwordgroup} \\
\wordbox[lrt]{2}{payload \\ (drr\_payloadlen bytes)} \\
\skippedwords \\
\wordbox[lrb]{1}{}
\end{bytefield}
-->
![Modified structure](https://rawgit.com/joyent/rfd/master/rfd/0014/new_dmu_replay_record.svg)

And the new fields to be added to the `drr_begin` nvlist:

 * `signed` (`boolean`) -- true if the stream is signed
 * `signature` (`nvlist`)
   * `alg` (`string`) -- public-key algorithm, one of `eddsa` or `ecdsa`
   * `curve` (`string`) -- OID or name of named elliptic curve
 * `key_fp` (`nvlist`)
   * `alg` (`string`) -- name of hash algorithm (`sha256`, `sha384` etc)
   * `hash` (`byte array`) -- hash of the public key

The acceptable combinations of `alg` and `curve` in `signature`:

| `alg`     | `curve` aliases     | `sizeof(drr_signature)` |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `'ecdsa'` | `'nistp256'`<br/>`'prime256v1'`<br/>`'1.2.840.10045.3.1.7'` | 64 |
| `'ecdsa'` | `'nistp384'`<br/>`'secp384r1'`<br/>`'1.3.132.0.34'` | 96 |
| `'eddsa'` | `'curve25519'`      | 64 |

Note that the selection of `alg` and `curve` together determines the size that
is used for the `drr_signature` member within all records in that stream.

Only 256 and 384-bit curves are permitted, in order to allow space for expansion
of the existing record header structures as needed. If 521-bit curves were
allowed, this would reduce the available space remaining after a
`drr_write_byref` to less than 4 words (36 bytes).

### User interface

As the signature is used to protect the data produced by the kernel, the keys
for signing will have to be kept in a kernel keyring.

On Illumos, the proposal is to augment the kernel crypto framework (KCF) with
some keyring management functions and better support for serializing and de-
serializing keys. The KCF already contains support for ECDSA with most common
curves, and can easily be enhanced to support EdDSA.

The kernel keyring will be loaded with two types of keys: key pairs used for
signing; and trusted public keys that will be accepted for receive operations.

Three new privileges will be added to the Illumos privilege model:
`PRIV_KERN_KEY_MGMT` (representing full control over the kernel keyring
framework), `PRIV_SYS_FS_IMPORT_KEY_MGMT` (only the ZFS signed send keyring),
and `PRIV_KERN_KEY_LIST` (to only list the `keyIds` or fingerprints of all
available keys). Non-global zones will not have any of these privileges by
default.

Also, the existing `PRIV_SYS_FS_IMPORT` privilege will be split into sub-
privileges `PRIV_SYS_FS_IMPORT_SIGNED` and `PRIV_SYS_FS_IMPORT_UNSIGNED`. The
intention is to only give non-global zones with delegated datasets the
`PRIV_SYS_FS_IMPORT_SIGNED` right in multi-tenant or high-security operations.

The `zfs send` command will be augmented to accept a `-s keyId` option to
produce a signed send stream. The `keyId` can be given as `default` to use the
first available private key on the ZFS keyring. If the user running `zfs send`
has only the `PRIV_SYS_FS_IMPORT_SIGNED` privilege, `-s default` will be
assumed always, unless `-s none` is provided. This is so that existing scripts
using `zfs send | zfs recv` can continue to work in an environment that allows
only signed streams.

The `zfs receive` command will also be augmented, with a `-s` option (no
argument), which imports a signed stream while verifying it against any matching
public key in the ZFS keyring. If `-s` is supplied and the stream is not signed, an error will be produced. Errors are also produced (and the import aborted) if
the signature does not verify successfully or the key fingerprint used cannot be
found in the ZFS keyring.

A second option to `zfs receive`, `-k` can be combined with `-s` to allow the
importation of streams that are unsigned or where the signing key cannot be
found on the ZFS keyring. If `-k` is given and the stream is found to be signed
with a known key, an error will still be produced if that signature is invalid.

Finally, if `zfs receive` is run by a user only possessing the
`PRIV_SYS_FS_IMPORT_SIGNED` privilege, the `-s` option will be implied by
default, and it will be an error to use `-k`.

## Analysis

### Security

 * All the supported signature algorithms are considered "128-bit secure", i.e.
   they have a security target >= 2<sup>128</sup> with the best known methods
   today.
 * The use of public-key algorithms for signing allows the fault domains for
   key exposure to be more tightly contained than a symmetric key
   infrastructure.
     * In this case though it does not necessarily improve overall system 
       security compared to using a symmetric HMAC key in the use case of
       multi-tenant non-global zones. The weakest link here is the isolation of
       the kernel keyring from the users.
 * As long as no data is ever written to the pool before a signature covering it
   has been validated, the only code that must be robust against malicious
   input is the minimum parsing code necessary to find and validate each
   signature.
     * This, however, does include the nvlist parser. The `drr_begin` nvlist
       payload must be opened to find the algorithm details and key to be used
       for validation. As a result, the nvlist parser must be safe against
       malicious input.
 * The code parsing the additional structure around the DMU stream in userland
   should be isolated using privilege separation techniques as much as possible.
     * Bugs here will not enable kernel privilege escalation, unlike bugs
       within the DMU stream proper, so not signing the whole package still
       provides worthwhile benefits.

### Performance

While performance will obviously depend on the implementation, Ed25519 is known
to achieve 71000 verifications per second, or 109000 signatures per second, per
core on a Nehalem-era Intel CPU. This is vastly smaller than the amount of time
spent hashing the data to produce the signature.

Proceeding with the Ed25519 example, which uses a SHA2-512 hash, we arrive at
the following performance ceilings on a Nehalem-era Intel (a performance ceiling
is the maximum possible rate we could produce a ZFS send stream at if we assume
signing is the dominant process and all other code is negligible):

| Assumed average record size | Estimated throughput ceiling |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 8KB                         | 290 MB/s                     |
| 32KB                        | 479 MB/s                     |
| 128KB                       | 572 MB/s                     |
| 16MB                        | 612 MB/s                     |

It seems reasonable to suppose that for extremely large amounts of data on
systems with very high amounts of disk bandwidth (and network bandwidth if
sending across one), it is likely this could become the limiting factor in ZFS
send performance. However, for more regular, small systems it is likely that
disk read bandwidth will still be more dominant than signing.

One option to amend this proposal if this performance is found to be a problem
is to use a faster hash algorithm on the actual data and sign only the
concatenated signatures of all the records in the stream so far.

Approaches based around making each signature cover more data (e.g. by only
putting `drr_signature` in every Nth record) will however not improve
performance significantly except with very very small records, as the
performance ceiling otherwise is always dominated by the cost of hashing the
data and not by the signature calculation itself.
