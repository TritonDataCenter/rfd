# RFD 96 Named thread API

## Introduction

Several other OSes including Linux (more precisely glibc), Solaris (11.3+),
FreeBSD, NetBSD, and QNX(!) support the ability to assign arbitrary names to
individual threads of a process.  This RFD proposes implementing a similar
facility for SmartOS.  Besides improved source-level compatibility, the
additional visibility could prove useful for analysis and debugging. 

## Interface

Both Linux\[[1]\] and Solaris\[[2]\] use the following functions to get/set thread names:
```
    int pthread_getname_np(pthread_t tid, char *name, size_t len);
    int pthread_setname_np(pthread_t tid, const char *name);
```

(NOTE: at least some Linux man pages\[[1]\] incorrectly show the first argument
as a pointer, however the glibc source shows the first argument is indeed just
`pthread_t`).

Solaris also includes the following functions:
```
    int pthread_attr_getname_np(pthread_attr_t *attr, char *name, size_t len);
    int pthread_attr_setname_np(pthread_attr_t *attr, const char *name);
```
NetBSD uses a slightly different syntax on the set functions:
```
    int pthread_setname_np(pthread_t tid, const char *name, void *arg);
    int pthread_attr_setname_np(pthread_attr_t *attr, const char *name, void *arg);
```

Where name can be a `printf(3c)` style format string and arg is the argument
(the function signature implies only a conversion specification, as it does not
end with `...`, however \[[3]\] is not clear on this).

FreeBSD only defines a single set name function:
```
    void pthread_set_name_np(pthread_t tid, const char *name);
```

With the exception of FreeBSD (which doesn't specify), all the other
implementations impose a maximum size on the name of a thread:

| Platform | Size (characters) |
| --------- | ------ |
| Linux | 16 |
| Solaris | 32 |
| NetBSD | `PTHREAD_MAX_NAMELEN_NP` (32) |

On Linux, the man page\[[1]\] explicitly states the thread name is modified and
read by reading the value out of `/proc/self/task/<tid>/comm`.  Consultation
with the glibc source indicates that this is only partially true.  If a thread
is setting or reading its own name (i.e. `tid == pthread_self()`),
`prctl(PR_{GET,SET}_NAME, name)` is used.  Only when the tid of another thread
is specified is `/proc` accessed.  The functions can return `ERANGE` if the
name is too long (set) or the buffer to hold the name is too small (get), as
well as any error returned by `open(2)`.  Again, the man page is slightly
misleading -- it returns `ERANGE` if `strlen(name) > 16` (set) or `len < 16`.
Since `comm` is also the process name, a new thread will inherit the process name
is its thread name.

On Solaris, it appears to silently truncate any oversized names.  It will
return `ESRCH` if the thread id doesn't exist, and in the get case, `EINVAL` if
a NULL buffer is supplied.

NetBSD returns `EINVAL` if the sizes in questions are larger than
`PTHREAD_MAX_NAMELEN_NP`.

On Linux, threads by default inherit the process name.

## Use

The primary use envisioned would be for utilities such as mdb(1), ps(1),
pstack(1), and prstat(1m) to be able to display the thread name (when present)
in addition to the thread id.  Additionally, it seems useful to make this
information available within core dumps for post-mortem analysis.  This of
course doesn't preclude additional uses beyond this, but merely a suggested
list of initial consumers.  Aside from userspace, it's also useful for kernel
threads to have names as well.

In addition, we should support reporting thread names within dtrace(1) descripts.

NOTE: The thread names in the below examples are merely illustrative.

### ps

ps(1) will gain a new format specifier `lwpname`, with header `LWPNAME`.

Any LWPs without a name will just display spaces (i.e. appear empty).

```
# ps -o pid,lwpname,comm
   PID LWPNAME                          COMMAND
...
     8                                  /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8                                  /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8 restarter_timeouts_event         /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8 restarter_event                  /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8 restarter_contracts_event        /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8 wait                             /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8 graph                            /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8 repository_event                 /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8 graph_event                      /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8                                  /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8                                  /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
     8                                  /lib/svc/bin/svc.startd
```

### prstat

The behavior of `prstat -L` will change slightly.  Currently, there is a
`PROCESS/LWPID` column that displays the process name and numeric lwpid.
Instead, this will change to `PROCESS/LWP`, with the last section displaying
an LWP name if set:

```
   PID USERNAME  SIZE   RSS STATE  PRI NICE      TIME  CPU PROCESS/LWP        
  6323 root       16G  227M cpu54    1    0   1:13:13 1.8% bhyve/34 [vcpu 11]
  8371 root     1656K  880K cpu6     1    0   2:04:44 1.8% 123456789012345/1
     4 root        0K    0K sleep   60    -   0:00:00 0.0% kcfpoold/15
```

Truncation is done such that the LWPID is always visible, and if needed,
the process name and/or the thread name is truncated.

### pstack

Currently for each thread, `pstack(1)` prints the lwpid.  This can be supplemented with the thread name when set:

```

```


### mdb

The `mdb(1)` command includes the genunix module which is used to both examine
system crash dumps as well as allow examination of a live system.

When `::ps -l` (show LWPs) is run, it is proposed to include the name after the LWP id when present:

```
> ::ps -l
S    PID   PPID   PGID    SID    UID      FLAGS             ADDR NAME
R      0      0      0      0      0 0x00000001 fffffffffbc37680 sched
        L              lwp0 ID: 1
...
R  18040   7990  18040  18040      0 0x42000000 ffffff04a2430028 nscd
        L  0xffffff04a9ea9300 ID: 1
        L  0xffffff04ad81ea40 ID: 2
        L  0xffffff0423db9040 ID: 3
        L  0xffffff04cdeb18c0 ID: 4
        L  0xffffff04ccd95780 ID: 5 [reaper]
        L  0xffffff042fb350c0 ID: 6 [revalidate]
        L  0xffffff042fb48200 ID: 7 [reaper]
```

The `::threadlist` command already has some support for useful thread names; this will be extended as seen in these examples:

```
            ADDR             PROC              LWP CMD/LWPID
fffffffffbc38660 fffffffffbc37680 fffffffffbc3a160 sched/1
...
ffffff000f40bc40 fffffffffbc37680                0 thread_reaper()
ffffff000f411c40 fffffffffbc37680                0 tq:kmem_move_taskq
...
fffffe23871160c0 fffffe23e34f8098 fffffe25a8bae3c0 bhyve/50 [vcpu 27]
fffffe249ceefc20 fffffe23e34f8098 fffffe2382d630c0 bhyve/51 [viona_rx_fffffe23939456d0]
```

Both the userspace and the kernel version of `::findstack` will report thread names:

```
> ::pgrep bhyve | ::walk thread | ::findstack  
stack pointer for thread fffffe25a8c83460 (bhyve/1 [mevent]): fffffcc26cacebb0
[ fffffcc26cacebb0 _resume_from_idle+0x12b() ]
  fffffcc26cacebe0 swtch+0x141()
  fffffcc26cacec70 cv_wait_sig_swap_core+0x1b9()
```

### dtrace

`dtrace(1m)` will have the `threadname` function which returns the name of the thread, or an empty string if not set.

```
$ dtrace -n ‘profile-997 /pid == $target && threadname != ""/ { @[threadname] == count(); }’ -c ./mycmd

larry     345
darrell    72
daryl      66
```

The Solaris version of `dtrace(1m)` has both `uthreadname` and `kthreadname` \[[4]\].  This proposal doesn't have two separate names for LWPs and kernel threads, so we are diverging here.

## Behavior

As noted above, Linux implements these commands either via `prctl()` or
manipulation of `/proc`.  The method of implementation in Solaris is unknown.
In FreeBSD, a specific syscall exists to set the name of a thread.  Since the
primary consumers are already heavy users of `proc(4)` in SmartOS, it seems
reasonable that we also utilize `proc(4)` to present the information for
consumers such as `ps(1)`, `pstack(1)`, etc.  The most sensible location would
be a somewhere under `/proc/<pid>/lwp/<lwpid>`.

There is some apparent differences in error handling as noted above.  Our
existing `pthreads(5)` implementation often uses `ESRCH` when commands that
take a `pthread_t` argument are given an non-existent thread id.  For
consistency, it is recommend we do the same for our
`pthread_{get,set}name_np()`.  This is also compatible with the documented
Solaris behavior, however it should be noted that this differs from the
documented Linux behavior.  On Linux, it should appear that the return value is
that of a file not found (`ENOENT`).  This should be taken into consideration
for lx-branded zones.

Solaris also returns `EINVAL` from `pthread_getname_np()` if passed a NULL buffer;
we will do the same. Solaris also silently truncates names greater than its max (32),
while Linux returns `ERANGE`; we will do what Linux does.

None of the implementations place any apparent restrictions on reading this
data, and there do not appear any expectations that the thread name should
contain any sort of sensitive information, so not requiring any additional
permissions or privileges beyond those needed to run `ps(1)` or `prstat(1m)` to
read this data seems sufficient.  Updating this information should be
restricted to the owner of the process and/or root.

We will not ape Linux's default thread names; it seems of little use to default
to the process name.

To avoid any issues with outputting untrusted thread names, we will insist,
kernel side, that the string must be entirely ASCII ``isprint()``.

## Implementation

Given that almost all the intended utilities already heavily utilize `proc(4)`
to operate, it seems natural to expose thread names via `proc(4)` as well.

For the lxbrand, it is suggested that we match the existing Linux behavior
and allow the reading/setting of thread names via the lx-brand proc (via
`/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/comm`) as well as `prctl()`.

As magic numbers are generally frowned upon, we will follow what NetBSD does
and define `PTHREAD_MAX_NAMELEN_NP` and set it's value to 32 (though this may
be set in terms of a kernel specific macro).  This size will include a
terminating `\0` character.  Since most software still detects illumos based
distributions as Solaris, it seems prudent to match it's sizing to limit
gratuitous incompatibility.  We can optionally limit this for lx-branded zones
to the expected 16 characters (including trailing `\0`).  It should be noted
that glibc currently (as of 2.25) performs this length check as well.

To support the lx brand, we already have a `kthread_t->t_name` member,
initialized to NULL. Since there are potentially multiple places
where a thread name is set (such as via `proc(4)`, lx-proc, or the lx prctl),
a kernel function with the name and signature `thread_setname(kthread_t *,
const char *)` will be created, along with a convenience routine `thread_setvname()`.

In addition, a macro `THREAD_NAME_MAX` will be created with a value of 32.

When called, if the given `kthread_t` has not had a thread name set on it
(i.e. `t_name` is `NULL`), it will allocate a `THREAD_NAME_MAX` sized buffer
and set `t_name` to point to this buffer.  This buffer will hold the name.
If a thread has already had a name set, the existing buffer will be reused,
and any existing value will be overwritten.  Reusing an existing buffer should
allow for the safe reading and writing of the value within the context of
DTrace.  At worst it might see a partially overwritten value if the thread
name is read while being changed.  We feel this is an acceptable risk.  By
adding the additional field to `kthread_t`, it will add an additional 8 bytes
(`sizeof (char *)` in a 64-bit kernel), of overhead for each thread created
on a system, and of course for every thread that sets a name, an additional
32 bytes of kernel memory will be used.  However, it seems likely that many
threads will not have names set, so this approach (vs. allocating all 32 bytes
for the name inside `kthread_t`) should hopefully minimize the kernel
footprint.  Initially at least, `thread_setname` will not be part of the DDI,
though nothing should preclude it's inclusion (or a DDI equivalent) in the
future.

In `proc(4)`, we introduce a new `/proc/<pid>/lwp/<lwpid>/lwpname` file.
The privileges required should match those currently required for reading
non-sensitive information from `/proc`.  In other words, the same privileges
required for `ps(1)` or `prstat(1m)` to run should also allow the reading
of thread names via `/proc`. As mentioned, writing would be restricted as
elsewhere.

Using a new file has the advantage of not causing any compatibility problems,
at the cost of slightly more complex API.

The contents of the file is simply a `THREAD_NAME_MAX` char buffer. If a thread
name is not set, reading from the buffer will return an empty string for
convenience.

Note that we don't intend to introduce a `/proc/<pid>/llwpname` file.

For use by older code, we'll also introduce `thr_getname()` and `thr_setname()`,
with the same semantics as described above.

### Core file contents

We will introduce a new note type NT_LWPNAME, which contains an `prlwpname_t`
structure. This is simply:

```
    uint64_t pr_lwpid;
    char pr_lwpname[THREAD_NAME_MAX];
```

We do this to make it easier to correlate a particular note entry back to the
LWP.

(If needed, we can rev this interface by introduce a new note type, so there
should be no need to sub-version this struct itself.)

### chroot

An open question that remains is around the interaction of these features and
`chroot(2)`.  As /proc is typically unavailable within a `chroot(2)`
environment, any part of the implementation dependent on `/proc` will not work.
Should there be a second mechanism for retrieving a thread name that does
not require the use of `/proc`?  Related to that, should setting a thread's name
be done through a mechanism other than `/proc` to allow thread names to be set
within a `chroot(2)` environment, or do we simply document that they do not
work in such instances.  How critical is it that this work with `chroot(2)`?
Linux is interesting in it half-works -- despite what the man pages claim,
a thread can set/get its own name via prctl (and in the glibc functions do
just that) and only use `/proc` for other threads.  If not `/proc`, how do we
set the thread name?  Should it be a new syscall?  Is there an existing
system call that can be sensibly extended to support it?  `/proc` can be mounted into a a `chroot(2)` environment, and processes require the `PRIV_PROC_CHROOT`
privilege in order to perform a `chroot(2)` call (which is not part of the 
basic privilege set--only root owned processes have it).  This might mitigate
any concerns surrounding a `/proc` only solution.

Searching on https://grok.pkgsrc.pub for both pthread\_setname\_np and chroot
showed that only ruby contained both.  These appear to just be autoconf checks.

This proposal does not plan to change this.

## Man Pages

There will be changes to `proc(4)`, `ps(1)`, and the `thr_*()` variants as well as
the new man pages below.

### pthread\_getname\_np

```
PTHREAD_GETNAME_NP(3C)   Standard C Library Functions   PTHREAD_GETNAME_NP(3C)

NAME
     pthread_getname_np, pthread_setname_np - get or set the name of a thread

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_getname_np(pthread_t tid, char *name, size_t len);

     int
     pthread_setname_np(pthread_t tid, const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_getname_np() and pthread_setname_np() functions,
     respectively, get and set the names of the thread whose id is given by
     the tid parameter.  For pthread_getname_np(), len indicates the size of
     name.

     Thread names are limited to PTHREAD_MAX_NAMELEN_NP including the
     terminating NIL.

     To clear a thread name, call pthread_setname_np() with NULL.

     Unlike some other systems, threads do not inherit the process name by
     default.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the pthread_getname_np() and
     pthread_setname_np() functions return 0.  Otherwise, an error number is
     returned to indicate the error.  If the thread identified by tid does not
     have a name set, pthread_getname_np will be set to an empty string
     (length = 0).

ERRORS
     Errors from open(2), pread(2), or pwrite(2) are possible.  In addition,
     the pthread_getname_np() function will fail with:

     EINVAL             The name argument is NULL.

     ERANGE             The size of name as given by len was not large enough
                        to contain the name of the thread.

     ESRCH              The thread tid was not found.

     The pthread_setname_np() function will fail with:

     ERANGE             The length of name exceeds the maximum allowed size.

     ESRCH              The thread tid was not found.

```
PTHREAD_ATTR_GETNAME_NP(3C)                       Standard C Library Functions

NAME
     pthread_attr_getname_np, pthread_attr_setname_np - get or set thread name
     attribute

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_attr_getname_np(pthread_attr_t *restrict attr, char *name,
         size_t len);

     int
     pthread_attr_setname_np(pthread_attr_t *restrict attr, const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_attr_setname_np() and pthread_attr_getname_np() functions,
     respectively, set and get the thread name attribute in attr to name.  For
     pthread_attr_getname_np(), len is the size of name.  Any threads created
     with pthread_create(3c) using attr will have their name set to name upon
     creation.  Thread names are limited to PTHREAD_MAX_NAMELEN_NP including
     the terminating NIL.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the pthread_attr_getname_np() and
     pthread_attr_setname_np() functions return 0.  Otherwise, an error number
     is returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_attr_getname_np() function may fail with:

     EINVAL             The name argument is NULL.

     ERANGE             The size of name as indicated by len is too small to
                        contain the attribute name.

     The pthread_attr_setname_np() function may fail with:

     ERANGE             The length of name given in name exceeds the maximum
                        size allowed.
