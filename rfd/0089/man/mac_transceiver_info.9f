.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mac_transceiver_set_type ,
.Fn mac_transceiver_set_present ,
and
.Fn mac_transceiver_set_usable
functions are used to set information about a transceiver as part of the
.Xr mct_info 9E
entry point to obtain information about a MAC transceiver. For more
information and background, see the
.Sy Transceiver Information Functions
section of
.Xr mac_capab_transceiver 9E .
.Pp
The
.Fn mct_transceiver_set_type
function sets the transceiver's type. A list of valid values for the
type is available in
.Xr mac_capab_transceiver 9E .
.Pp
The
.Fn mct_transceiver_set_present
function sets whether or not the transceiver is present and plugged into
the system. If the transceiver is not plugged in, then the function
should be called with
.Fa present set to
.Dv B_FALSE ,
otehrwise it should use
.Dv B_TRUE .
.Pp
The
.Fn mct_transceiver_set_usable
function determines whether or not the device can use the transceiver.
If the device cannot use the transceiver, then it should call the
function with
.Fa usable
set to
.Dv B_FALSE .
Otherwise, it should use
.Dv B_TRUE .
If the transceiver is not present, then this function should not be
called.
.Sh CONTEXT
These functions should be called in response to handling the
.Fn mct_info 9E
entry point for transceivers in
.Sy kernel
context.
