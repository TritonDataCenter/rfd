This interface is evolving still in illumos. API and ABI stability is
not guaranteed.
.Sh PARAMETERS

.It Fa uip
A pointer to a UFM image that was passed to the driver in its
.Xr ddi_ufm_op_fill_image 9E
entry point.

A human-readable description of the firmware image.
.It Fa nvl
An nvlist_t with ancillary, device-specific data.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ddi_ufm_image_set_desc
and
.Fn ddi_ufm_image_set_misc
functions are used by device drivers to set information about a firmare
image on the image structure
.Fa uip
as a part of implementing their
.Xr ddi_ufm_op_fill_image 9E
entry point. For more information on images and the use of these
functions, see the descrption of the
.Fn ddi_ufm_op_fill_image
function in
.Xr ddi_ufm 9E .
.Pp
The
.Fn ddi_ufm_image_set_desc
function sets the description of the fimrware image. This description is
intended for administrators and should convey the intended use of the
image.
.Pp
The
.Fn ddi_ufm_image_set_misc
function is used by drivers to set ancillary key-value data that may be
useful to a consumer. The driver should create an nvlist for this
purpose with
.Xr nvlist_alloc 9F.
Once the driver passes the nvlist to the
.Fn ddi_ufm_image_set_misc
function, then the driver must not manipulate or free the nvlist at all.
It is the property of the UFM subsystem.
.Sh CONTEXT
These function should only be called in the context of the
.Xr ddi_ufm_op_fill_image 9E
entry point. However, these functions may be called from
.Sy kernel
context.
