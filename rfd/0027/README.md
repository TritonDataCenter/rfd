# RFD 0027 CMON: Triton Container Monitor
## Introduction
Presently, Triton does not offer a always-on mechanism for engineers and
operators to collect metrics about their containers and have them ingested by
their existing systems. Many engineers and operators have pre-existing
monitoring solutions such as Nagios, Graylog, ELK, and Splunk. The intent of
this RFD is to define a solution that allows customers to easily attach their
existing solutions to the metrics that are available via SmartOS commands and
DTrace probes, while simultaneously leveraging existing open-source tooling
where possible.


## Goals
* Produce a clearly defined interface for users and operators to extract data
  that is readily available in SmartOS today.
* The end result should facilitate a persistent instrumentation of the
[USE Method](http://www.brendangregg.com/USEmethod/use-smartos.html) (or some
subset of it at a minimum).
* Should not limit the set of potential customer ingest solutions.
* Should allow customers to use a push or a pull model externally.
* Should not require operators to store metric data on behalf of end users.
* If possible, leverage an existing open source tool with traction.

## Use Case Examples
### End user
* Real time alarms for resource utilization (disk capacity, CPU, DRAM, etc.).
* Monitor the impact of app utilization and throughput on container utilization.
* Correlate resource metrics with application metrics.
### Operators
* ZFS zpool health (metrics and alerts)
* Compute node utilization (metrics and alerts)

## Note
This RFD is a precursor to
[RFD 0017](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/blob/master/rfd/0017/README.md) and it
is likely that it will both complimentary and foundational.

## Inspirational Reading
[Push vs Pull](http://www.boxever.com/push-vs-pull-for-monitoring) for metrics

## The Case For A Pull Based Architecture

While the inspirational reading link above provides a broad description of when
push or pull based metrics may be appropriate, an explanation of why pull based
metrics are best in this scenario seems called for.

Because Container Monitor is being built to provide data to external customer
systems with a broad set of requirements (e.g. data staleness, format, delivery,
etc.), pushing data to these systems could introduce needless complexity.

Consider the following scenario: Customer A has 10,000 containers and requires
that data be no older than 5 minutes. Customer B has 1000 containers and
requires data be no older than 15 seconds. If we assume equal payload per packet
customer B requires twice the bandwidth of customer A, with an order of
magnitude less containers. From a bandwidth perspective, push and pull are not
different.

Now consider the same scenario with an eye toward delivery. In a push model our
infrastructure will be constantly pushing every 15 seconds to customer B and
every 5 minutes to customer A. If either customer's endpoint goes down or
becomes unreachable (network partition), our infrastructure lacks a good way to
know if it should continue pushing data to customers. Intelligence, buffering,
and backoff could be added to the push agent, but that means that each metric
agent on each compute node must juggle tens if not hundreds of different
customer endpoints and their respective backoff and buffering state per compute
node, in addition to remembering the push interval for each customer.

Apply that same problem to a pull based model and each metric agent responds
on-demand when a customers endpoint polls on a given interval. The only
intelligence required is the allowable polling rate per customer. The metric
agent does not care if the customers endpoint is up or down and only sends data
when it will actually be processed. If a customer tries to pull more frequently
than allowed, the metric agent can respond appropriately, but more realistically
this will be handled by the metric proxy as to not put unnecessary load on
compute nodes.

This isn't intended to be an exhaustive list of scenarios, but I do think it
demonstrates the thought process behind choosing a pull based architecture. It
isn't that this can't be done with a push based model, it's that a push based
model makes the design more complicated than necessary, especially when you take
into consideration that the end users collection point may not be under the
control of the operator of the cloud.


## Existing Solutions
### [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/)
>Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company.

A distinguishing feature of Prometheus is that it uses a pull mechanism instead
of a push mechanism for metric delivery. This is advantageous because it helps
accomplish the goal of facilitating the delivery of metric data, but not storing
it. That said, allowing customers to have this data pushed to them is also a
goal. Adding a customer zone that acts as a Prometheus poller and pushes data to
a configurable protocol and endpoint may accommodate that requirement nicely.

Prometheus is already a supported platform for Docker and Kubernetes.
It has an open-source user base that appears to be similar in size to ours, and
many large companies are already using it for this purpose. Additionally,
support for service discovery via [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) and DNS is
available to alleviate manual configuration. This means operators and end users
can leverage our own CNS or Consul.

### [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/)
>InfluxData provides a robust, open source and fully customizable time-series data management platform backed by 24/7 enterprise support. InfluxData has helped hundreds of startups and multi-national corporations solve complex data challenges.

InfluxDB has a really nice SQL like CLI, and data points are formed much like
they are with Prometheus. Unfortunately InfluxDB uses a push mechanism

### [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/)
Has a very nice dashboard and is extremely configurable. Unfortunately it's
based on a push model using Syslog and/or GELF. In addition, Graylog has _lots_
of moving parts (e.g. MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Java, etc.) which make it
undesirable from an operational perspective.

### [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/products)
>By combining the massively popular Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana, Elasticsearch Inc has created an end-to-end stack that delivers actionable insights in real time from almost any type of structured and unstructured data source. Built and supported by the engineers behind each of these open source products, the Elasticsearch ELK stack makes searching and analyzing data easier than ever before.

A popular combination of tools in the open-source arena. Unfortunately, ELK
requires a push mechanism _and_ storing data. That said, Logstash may warrant
more consideration as it applies to the metric proxy or metric translator
components.

### [Juttle](http://juttle.github.io/juttle/)
>Juttle is an analytics system and language for developers built upon a stream-processing core and targeted for presentation-layer scale. Juttle gives you an agile way to query, analyze, and visualize live and historical data from many different big data backends or other web services. Using the Juttle dataflow language, you can specify your presentation analytics in a single place with a syntax modeled after the classic unix shell pipeline. There is no need to program against data query and visualization libraries. Juttle scripts, or juttles, tie everything together and abstract away the details.

Juttle is more of a language or stream-processing system than an end to end
solution or protocol. It has many similarities to our own Manta, and a powerful
syntax. Juttle is currently pivoting it's strategy, and it is not clear how it
would easily fit into our infrastructure.

### [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/wiki)
>StatsD is a simple NodeJS daemon (and by “simple” I really mean simple — NodeJS makes event-based systems like this ridiculously easy to write) that listens for messages on a UDP port. (See Flickr’s “Counting & Timing” for a previous description and implementation of this idea, and check out the open-sourced code on github to see our version.) It parses the messages, extracts metrics data, and periodically flushes the data to graphite.

StatsD is popular, simple, and based on NodeJS. Its main drawback is a push
model that would require us storing or caching data for some period of time.

### [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)
>cAdvisor (Container Advisor) provides container users an understanding of the resource usage and performance characteristics of their running containers. It is a running daemon that collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information about running containers. Specifically, for each container it keeps resource isolation parameters, historical resource usage, histograms of complete historical resource usage and network statistics. This data is exported by container and machine-wide.

This is the de facto docker monitoring daemon, and it also has Prometheus
support built in. If cAdvisor could be baked into our Docker implementation
easily, it would compliment a Prometheus based solution quite well.

### [OpenTSDB](http://opentsdb.net/)
>OpenTSDB consists of a Time Series Daemon (TSD) as well as set of command line utilities. Interaction with OpenTSDB is primarily achieved by running one or more of the TSDs. Each TSD is independent. There is no master, no shared state so you can run as many TSDs as required to handle any load you throw at it. Each TSD uses the open source database HBase to store and retrieve time-series data.

A powerful time series database which supports a pull mechanism. However, given
it's complexity (e.g. HBase Hadoop requirement), it seems unlikely that we can
reach a wide audience by standardizing on this.

## Chosen Solution
Expose metrics in a way that is compatible with the Prometheus
[text format HTTP client](http://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#format-version-0-0-4)
specification. This is distinctly different from the Prometheus HTTP API and
server components, which will not be implemented.

Furthermore, a blueprint and/or Docker image for forwarding metrics to
pre-existing customer solutions should be created so that customers do not have
to feel locked into the Prometheus model or be forced to switch.

Prometheus facilitates each of the goals listed above, has a great amount of
open-source traction, and provides an end-to-end solution. Users can easily spin
up a new Prometheus server in minutes and start polling new metrics. Thanks to
the optional metric forwarding, users with existing time-series stores can also
get up to speed quickly.

## Components
### Agent (Container Monitor Agent)
* Must operate under the following hard constraints
  * Minimal impact on compute nodes / prevent brownout
  * Must be operational even when operator and customer zones are not

Runs in the global zone on the head node and compute nodes. It provides a
Prometheus compatible HTTP endpoint for the proxy to make requests of.

```
GET <cn_admin_ip>/v1/<vm_uuid>/metrics
---
    # HELP cpucaps_usage_percent current CPU utilization
    # TYPE cpucaps_usage_percent gauge
    cpucaps_usage 0
    ...
```

The agent also exposes an endpoint for forcing an update of its mapping of
vm_uuid to zone_id. This mapping is necessary because kstats work on zone_id
not vm_uuid for the most part.

```
POST <cn_admin_ip>/v1/refresh
```

The Agent caches values and allows for a configurable expiration/TTL.
Metrics are always be retrievable, however they will remain unchanged for the
duration of the cached value TTL. Metric Agent collection will only be made if a
cached value does not exist or the currently cached value is expired.

The Agent should support an operator configurable global minimum polling
frequency. This will allow an operator to dial back metric collection on an
overloaded compute node and potentially avoid stopping the Metric Agent.

Pre-defined metrics will be collected using the Metric Instrumenter defined in
[RFD 37](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/blob/master/rfd/0037/README.md), which
will leverage modules like [node-kstat](https://github.com/bcantrill/node-kstat)
.

The reasoning behind running in the global zone is that metrics are necessary in
scenarios where an in-zone agent may become unresponsive (e.g. CPU caps exceeded
, DRAM exceeded, etc.).

While this is likely the most correct location, and the only reasonable way to
comply with the defined constraints, it is not without drawbacks. If the agent
lived in-zone the failure domain has more breadth
(i.e. the failure of one Metric agent only impacts a single zone), and its
resource utilization could be easily controlled by existing functionality. With
the Metric agent living in the global zone, a crash will result in all zones on
that CN lacking data until it comes back up. It is also easier for the agent to
become a noisy neighbor.

### Proxy (Container Monitor)
* Must operate under the following hard constraints
  * The same user limitations as sdc-docker
  * Flexible enough to support future versions of RBAC
  * Highly available
  * Prevent causing system brownout

The Proxy lives between a customers Prometheus server and the
Agents that live on each compute node. It is also a highly available
cluster per data center.

Every container will have a DNS CNAME record which points at the proxy cluster.
In this way, the proxy can respond as if it was the monitored instance itself by
multiplexing on the request hostname.

This is an operator controlled zone, deployed with sdcadm. The zone will need to
have a leg on the admin network in order to talk with the Metric Agent, and a
leg on the external network to expose it to customers.

For customers that can use Prometheus data directly or via a
[plugin](https://github.com/prometheus/nagios_plugins), this and the Metric
Client are the only components that need to be in place.

Customers Prometheus servers will need to be authenticated and authorized. The
proxy will utilize the same TLS based scheme as the official Prometheus agents.
Customers existing SSH key(s) (the same key(s) used for accessing instances and
sdc-docker) will be used.

Authentication and authorization will also be leveraged to decide how many
polling requests an end user is allowed to make within a configurable amount
of time.

User request quota will default to an operator set value, and an optional per
user maximum can also be set by an operator.

For example, a per user default could be 1000 requests per minute, and a global
per user maximum could be 10000 requests per minute. Operators can choose
whether or not to throttle users that go beyond 1000 requests per minute or
charge them. That said, users are not allowed to violate the global per user
maximum request quota if it is set. The goal is not to limit users ever, but we
must comply with the constraint of preventing CN and cloud brownout if possible.

If configured, users who poll beyond their allotment or global maximum will
receive a [HTTP 429](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#page-3) response.

### Discovery

When proxies are provisioned or destroyed CNS will detect the change and
create or remove a proxy A record automatically.

```
    <region>.cmon.triton.zone A 10.99.99.7
```

When new containers are created, CNS will detect the change and create a DNS
record

```
    <vm_uuid>.cm.triton.zone CNAME <region>.cmon.triton.zone
```

for each container. Going forward all new containers will get a Container
Monitor CNAME record automatically. Similarly, proxy records will be added
and removed when proxies come and go, along with corresponding CNAME records.

Each CNAME record represents a virtual Prometheus endpoint backed by a proxy.

A proxy based Prometheus service discovery module will be built and hopefully
accepted for inclusion in the main Prometheus repository. This will function and
be configured similarly to the existing
[ec2 service discovery module](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/#ec2_sd_config).

For users running pre-existing Prometheus servers, the suggested service
discovery mechanism will be leveraging [file based service discovery](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/#<file_sd_config>)
in conjunction with our Prometheus autopilot pattern. In this way they'll get an
equivalent experience to the CloudAPI based discovery without having to upgrade
their Prometheus installation.

## Architecture Overview
![Container Monitor Layout](http://us-east.manta.joyent.com/shmeeny/public/ContainerMonitor_rev2.png)

## Happy Path Walk Through

### Proxy Creation
* Operator deploys new proxies using sdcadm
* VMAPI pushes a changefeed event to CNS
* CNS creates A records of the form
```
    <region>.cmon.triton.zone A 10.99.99.7
```
for each proxy deployed with sdcadm

### Container Creation
* User creates a new container
* VMAPI pushes a changefeed event to CNS and the proxy
* CNS creates CNAME records of the form

```
<vm_uuid>.cm.triton.zone CNAME <region>.cmon.triton.zone
```
* Proxy caches details about about the new container
* Proxy instructs the agent on the CN where the new container resides to refresh
  it's vm_uuid to zoneid mapping to include the new container. This is achieved
  by calling the `/v1/refresh` route.

### End User Configuration
* Install and run a Prometheus server
    * Create prometheus.yml [configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/)
        * TLS configuration is required, use the same cert and key that you
          configured for use with CloudAPI, sdc-docker, etc.
        * Add a job for the availability zones that your containers run in,
          using Triton discovery.
          ```
          - job_name: <account_name>_<region>
            scheme: https
            tls_config:
              cert_file: /path/to/valid_cert_file
              key_file: /path/to/valid_key_file
              insecure_skip_verify: true
            triton_sd_configs:
              - account: '<account_name>'
                dns_suffix: 'cmon.<region>.triton.zone'
                endpoint: 'cmon.<region>.triton.zone'
                version: 1
                tls_config:
                  cert_file: /path/to/valid_cert_file
                  key_file: /path/to/valid_key_file
                  insecure_skip_verify: true
          ```
    * User deploys a Triton Linux Container
      ```
      $ triton instance create -w --name=prometheus01 ubuntu-14.04 t4-standard-1G
      ```
    * User secure copies pem files and config to the newly deployed Prometheus
      server
      ```
      $ scp pem_config.tgz root@prometheus01:.
      ```
    * User logs into Prometheus server
      ```
      $ ssh root@prometheus01
      ```
    * Download the official Prometheus server binaries
      ```
      $ wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v1.5.0/prometheus-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
      ```
    * User runs the Prometheus server
      ```
      $ ./prometheus -config.file=prometheus.yml
      ```
    * Prometheus server polls the proxy `/v1/discover` endpoint to discover
      scrape targets

      ```
    * The proxy marshals the agent response back to the calling server
    * Container Monitor data is now available in the users Prometheus endpoint

### Container Destroyed
* User destroys a container
* VMAPI pushes a changefeed event to CNS and the proxy
* CNS removes the CNAME records associated with the container
* Proxy removes the container from its local cache and make a call to
  `/v1/refresh` on agent where the container was removed.

### Proxy destroyed
* Operator destroys a proxy
* VMAPI pushes a changefeed event to CNS
* CNS removes the A record associated with the proxy and all CNAME records that
  reference it.

## High Availability
### Agent
This is a single agent on a compute or head node, it has no more availability
than the other supporting agents like cn-agent and vm-agent. Additional agents
would only be helpful in the case of an agent crash, and not node failure. At
this time it does not make sense to provide guarantees beyond SMF restarts.

### Proxy
This is an entirely stateless service and because of that there is no limit to
the number of proxies that can be in use at a given time. The proxy can be
deployed with sdcadm to multiple nodes in a given data center. The recommended
deployment is three Metric Agent Proxies, one on the headnode and the other two
on different compute nodes which are ideally in different racks.

When multiple proxies are in use, CNS and round robin DNS
(e.g. multiple A records per <vm_uuid>.cm.triton.zone) will be leveraged.
To ensure minimum disruption in the case of a proxy failure, a low TTL should
be used.

## Scaling
### Agent
Because the Agent is a single agent running on a compute or head node, there
is no good way of scaling it. That said, it does need to be sensitive to
overloading the global zone.

In order to protect the global zone, the Agent will have a runtime configurable
throttle.

### Proxy
Multiple Proxy zones can be added as load requires and without penalty. When
new Proxies are added, CNS will detect this and add new A records as well as
the necessary CNAME records.

## Dynamic metrics (e.g. on-demand DTrace integration)
Dynamic metrics are out of scope for version one of Container Monitor. The
intent is to add support for dynamic metrics in a future version by leveraging
the HTTP mechanism of the Metric Agent (e.g. a POST could be made that tells the
agent to start collecting specific metrics that would be automatically injected
into the Prometheus compatible response).

## Triton CLI integration
The Triton CLI should be able to act as a Prometheus polling server. This will
act both as a debugging tool and a convenient ad-hoc stats gathering mechanism
for end users.

* Examples provided as a loose example of what could be done. This is not
  intended to be prescriptive at this time.

```
    # default raw response
    $ triton monitor <container uuid or name>
    ...
    cpucaps_usage 0
    cpucaps_below 16208
    cpucaps_value 100
    ...
```

```
    # Formatted response listing vm caps data
    $ triton monitor <container uuid or name> --caps
        VM_UUID                                 value    usage    maxusage
        fbb8e583-9c87-4724-ac35-7cefb46c0f7b    100      0        87
        ...
```
## Default Metric Collection
At a minimum, we should provide a subset of the official Prometheus
[node exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#enabled-by-default)
metrics

### Static Metrics Collected
Name     | Description | Native Metrics | Mapping
---------|-------------|----------------|--------
cpu | Exposes CPU statistics | kstat zones:::[nsec_user,nsec_waitrq] | aggregate usage, wait time
filesystem | Exposes filesystem statistics, such as disk space used. | zfs list [used, available] | storage space used, available
loadavg | Exposes load average. | kstat zones:::avenrun_1min | load average over one minute
meminfo | Exposes memory statistics. | kstat memory_cap:::[rss,physcap,swap,swapcap] | aggregate usage, limit, swap, swap limit
netdev | Exposes network interface statistics such as bytes transferred. | kstat link:::[ipackets64,opackets64,rbytes64,obytes64] | aggregate packets in, out, bytes in, out
time | Exposes the current system time. | gettimeofday(3C) | system's notion of the current time

## Forwarder
For customers that need to have data pushed to them, and can't use an existing
Prometheus plugin, a Forwarder zone can be deployed. This zone will poll
a configurable set of Proxy endpoints for data (just like a Prometheus
server), translate it to the desired metric format
(e.g. [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/), Syslog, etc.), and push the
translated data to the customers existing system.

This is provisioned by the customer and not in the scope of this RFD. That said,
in the near future Joyent will create a few blueprints to help customers get
started. The blueprints may be for Syslog, statsd, InfluxDB, etc.
